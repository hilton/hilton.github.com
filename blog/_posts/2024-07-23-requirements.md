Please stop talking about software requirements.
[Requirements analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_analysis)
relies on customers who can articulate their needs,
and understand and commit to a corresponding
[requirements specification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_requirements_specification).
These customers sound great but, like Santa Claus,
Iâ€™ve never seen them and no longer believe they really exist.

In product management, the very notion of a _requirement_ sounds like a category error.
_Constraints_, which you share with your competitors, come closest: security, and
[not breaking the law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_compliance),
for example.

## Requirements mindset

From a product management perspective,
stakeholders have problems and _wishes_, not requirements.
If you set out to discover all of their so-called requirements,
you will end up with an [infinite backlog](infinite-backlog) that you will cannot ever complete.
Don't try to boil the ocean.

Requirements only exist in the context of a project-based business model that works badly for most kinds of software development.
But in software product development,
you wonâ€™t ever reach a point where you have implemented all of the requirements.
It doesnâ€™t work like that.


## Vestigial waterfall

The word _requirement_ indicates vestigial waterfall software development:
the idea that development teams build software that _someone else_
has somehow defined in advance.
Even if you don't work that way yourself, you may find yourself working with people who did in the past,
especially on fixed-price software development projects that extract profit from the clientâ€™s own attempt to avoid previous project failure.

Words matter, and apparently outlast business models. 
Holding on to the language of _requirements_,
because we don't know what to call our [units of work](units-of-work),
holds us back.
It holds product management back.


## Requirements documents

As well as talking about requirements, we write about them. 
The _requirements document_ and _product requirements specification_ belong to the past,
but product managers still make 
[the PRD mistake](product-documents)
that encapsulates and perpetuates requirements thinking.

Good writing offers another clue: avoiding 
[passive voice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_passive_voice).
You can recognise passive constructions like:

> the software was designed

when you can add _by zombies_, because the phrase doesnâ€™t identify another actor:

> the software was designed **by zombies** ðŸ§Ÿ

Similarly, you can also fix requirements written with the usual
[MoSCoW method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MoSCoW_method)
phrasing:

> the software MUST do X

which might as well read:

> ðŸ§Ÿ **zombies think** the software MUST do X

Requirements share passive constructionsâ€™ fake objectivity in how they obscure _who_ requires particular product characteristics.
As a product manager, state your audience.

## Objectives > requirements

[Objectives and key results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectives_and_key_results) (OKRs)
offer a popular alternative to requirements thinking.
Instead of attempting to specify a software product by stating which requirements the â€˜finishedâ€™ product must satisfy,
OKRs focus on outcomes.

I recommend three different books that introduce OKRs, each taking a different perspective:

1. [Succeeding with OKRs in Agile](agile-okrs-review) - agile software development focus
2. [Radical Focus](radical-focus-review) - start-up focus
3. [Who Does What By How Much?](who-does-what-by-how-much-review) - broad adoption

Organisations get different things out of OKRs, but everyone can take advantage of a new vocabulary.
Instead of _requirements_, talk about objectives, results and outcomes.
And most importantly, as a product manager, refer to your discovery work with customers.
You wouldnâ€™t want anyone to think you take instructions from Zombies.
