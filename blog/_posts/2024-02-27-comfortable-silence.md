We rarely feel calm and relaxed in meetings at work.
Even regular team meetings can feel forced,
and nothing like an easy conversation among friends.

A presumption of non-stop _talking_ has taken over our meetings.	
You probably can’t stop talking for even five seconds without someone speaking up to fill the gap.

## Awkward silence

In a group setting, silence makes some people feel uncomfortable,
while speech provides continuous structure.
This helps attendees, who do need to understand how to follow the meeting and participate,
but that doesn’t have to only mean talking and listening.

Silence during a meeting feels awkward when you feel lost in it, and don’t know what it means.
[Awkward silence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awkward_silence) doesn’t feel _safe_.

## Dead air

Only exceptional scenarios _require_ continuous talking.
Radio broadcasters, for example, refer to unintentionally broadcast silence as
[dead air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_air):

{:.big style="max-width:29em"}
> Among professional broadcasters, dead air is considered one of the worst things that can occur.

As a result, radio DJs master the art of continuous coherence, even if they don’t actually say much.
Fortunately, the teams I know don’t livestream their meetings, and don’t have to worry about this.
Sometimes, we need a break from talking.

## Time to think

We overuse the term _meeting_ for a wide range of group activities,
from private chats to practical group workshops.
These different activities have different needs.

When we use meetings to work on problems together, we need time to:

1. ask questions
2. share ideas
3. _think_.

A lively group discussion helps surface questions and ideas,
but all the talking doesn’t leave much space for thinking and creativity.
Solving problems and discovering new ideas requires individual reflection.
In silence.

## Comfortable silence

Once a team gets used to working together,
they can replace awkward silence with _comfortable silence_.
When team members can share a space without needing someone to talk,
whether in person or online, they have more options for how to work together.

Once you allow occasional silence into your meetings,
you also realise how much unnecessary interjections disrupt the meeting’s purpose.
Too often, the people who _just have to_ comment on everything, have the least to contribute.
When people can take time to focus on what they’ve just heard,
they can even stick to a meeting agenda.

Comfortable silence especially helps distributed teams, 
who otherwise have to explicitly enter or leave an online meeting, start or stop a discussion.
In this sense, comfortable silence typifies several people working quietly in the same ‘room’.
Online, it allows distributed team members to keep a video call open while they work quietly,
sharing a reassuring presence.

## Psychological safety

Comfortable silence, like many signs of a healthy team, requires psychological safety.
Without it, people treat a meeting as a performance, for colleagues who won’t accept _dead air_.

Without psychological safety, nervousness will make itself heard:
nervous laughs and awkward jokes escalate a meeting’s awkwardness factor.	
Without safety no one achieves productivity, let alone their best work.

In the absence of better management, meeting facilitation can help teams get there.
When they don’t have comfortable silence,
a meeting facilitator can temporarily establish it by setting boundaries:

> I’ve set a timer for five minutes so let’s use that time to write down your ideas in silence.

The next step comes when a team member suggests this without the facilitator, 
or even confidently expresses their own need for time to think, instead of overthinking the silence.

My former colleague, Maya Nedeljkovich, put it best: ‘psychological safety is the difference between an awkward silence and a comfortable one’.
