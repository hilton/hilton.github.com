I kept [The Goal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Goal_(novel)) on my wish list for years,
along with other classics that I wanted to have read, but hadn’t.
I probably worried that I’d find it old and boring, and struggle to finish it.

Then I got a copy of the third edition, helped by secondhand books’ randomness, and recently actually read it.
And like many classics, I now wish I’d read it years ago.

## Readability

Ten pages in, I found myself enjoying the story.
A factory manager has three months to fix the factory’s problems, or face its closure.
I found it well-paced and easy to follow, and hard to put down.

We take novels’ readability for granted, while struggling with badly-written non-fiction.
Perhaps we expect reading business books to feel like hard work, and settle for relevance and structure.
But while _The Goal_’s [hero’s journey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey) feels simplistic as a novel,
a business book can never have too much readability.

## Clarification

In the story’s factory context, it turns out that a single machine imposes a bottleneck on the production process,
and means that the factory’s total productivity can never exceed that one machine’s.
Fortunately, if you might read _The Goal_ in the future, you didn’t just read a spoiler.
This factory bottleneck becomes the start of a continuous improvement story, not the end.

As the story moves from one kind of bottleneck to the next, it clarified my understanding.
Meanwhile it also helped reflect on how we translate the key manufacturing measures
of throughput, operational expense, and inventory to software products and services.
Inevitably, this soon led to something I’d never previously considered.

## Revelation

After a while, the protagonist has improved the factory’s performance so much that he and his team struggle to find the next improvement opportunity.
At this point the mentor introduces the idea that their constraint might now lie _outside the building_.
Instead of customers waiting for the factory to deliver orders, the factory becomes limited by waiting for new customers:
the constraint had become sales and marketing.

Before reading _The Goal_, I worried that its manufacturing context would make it less relevant than
[The Phoenix Project](https://itrevolution.com/product/the-phoenix-project/),
a more recent IT-focused retelling of _The Goal_.
Instead, these differences between manufacturing and software provoked thoughts!

Manufacturing can have stable products, and factories whose output doesn’t satisfy customer demand.
But software has continuously updated products, and ‘production’ that rarely constrains the number of sales.
Cloud services run on the assumption that the ‘production’ (cloud hosting) environment can
always scale to support more customers.

This got me rethinking a product’s relationships.
A product capabilities may affect the size of the market it serves,
and product marketing and onboarding affect how much of that market a product can capture.

## Diversion

Overall, I liked that a rich and thought-provoking journey into the 
[theory of constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints) came in the form of such an enjoyable read.
I value that, because it meant that it only took me a couple of days of less tiring reading to finish the book,
instead of the months I’d struggled with the previous business book I read.

On reflection, I appreciate the diversion into manufacturing,
and the reminder that every [subject matter domain](domain-primers) includes interesting problems.
I wish we all had more good business novels to read.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ **Recommended.**
