When I first worked remote,
I had the worst part of the experience in meetings with a group of people in a meeting room.
Table-top microphones made it difficult to understand people talking,
and half the time, the presenter failed to connect it leaving me with a laptop microphone that couldn‚Äôt hear anyone else.

## Online meetings

Most people already find it too hard to run meetings effectively, and barely try.
Better meetings, especially online, require effort, discipline or both.
By comparison, better audio upgrades the online meeting experience more easily than anything else.
After all, what you can hear defines the meeting experience more than what you can see.

Listing to people speaking requires more concentration when you have low-quality audio,
much like how listening to a someone speaking a foreign language makes you tired more quickly,
or even your own native language but with an accent.
Online meetings in tech typically feature both, for most attendees.

## Hybrid meetings

Hybrid meetings make audio problems worse,
because you have to combine remote attendees with whole-room audio.
When some participants share a speaker and microphone in a meeting room,
preventing these problems requires expensive equipment.
The rest of this article focuses on fully-remote meetings, in which all participants connect individually.

## Wear headphones

First, wear headphones to prevent your microphone picking up other meeting attendees‚Äô audio,
when you unmute yourself.
Online meeting software can filter out meeting audio from a nearby speaker,
but at a cost to how clear you sound.
Even then, it sometimes fails, causing echo or audio feedback that disrupts the meeting.

## Start with a cheap headset

While working remote for the first time, I once had an online meeting with a customer in another country,
with clearer and louder audio than any of my colleagues.
I emailed him after the meeting, to ask what equipment he had,
and he replied that he _only had a cheap headset_ ‚Äì a
[Sennheiser PC-8](https://www.eposaudio.com/en/nl/products/pc-8-usb-voice-over-ip-headset-1000432)
(now branded as _Epos_).
I immediately ordered my own.

You drastically improve your audio by positioning your microphone a few centimetres from your mouth.
Headsets like the PC-8 use a microphone boom (arm) to position the microphone just in front of the corner of your mouth.
And for less than ‚Ç¨30, you don‚Äôt have any _good_ reasons for not making sure everyone on your team has audio at least this good.

## Avoid wireless

When I switched to my cheap PC-8 headset, I discovered unexpected benefits:

1. its cheap lightweight plastic construction make it comfortable, and not too hot in summer
2. the wired USB connection meant that I never had Bluetooth connection issues or interference
3. the headset didn‚Äôt have batteries to run out at inconvenient times.

I enjoy Bluetooth‚Äôs convenience away from my desk,
but reliable always-connected audio at my desk felt like a revelation.
I never had to worry about joining a meeting, and having to wait for an audio connection,
or batteries running out.
For regular online meetings at your desk, use wired headphones and microphone.

Bluetooth audio quality drops when you switch from the profile for listing to music,
to the profile that supports two-way audio with a microphone.
Bluetooth headphones with a built-in microphone suffer twice:
they position the microphone too far from your mouth, and their low-bandwidth audio lacks clarity
(and gets worse with occasional interference).

## Value empathy and inclusion

When you have a bad microphone in online meetings,
you give other people a bad experience, especially when not talking in their native language.
Upgrading your audio in meetings shows empathy for your colleagues,
because it improves their meeting experience, not yours.

If your employer doesn‚Äôt give everyone a basic headset,
you have opportunity to start bottom-up, in your own team.
And if you have a generous office equipment budget and care about each other you can go further,
like the fully-remote team with the love language of _excellent audio_.üéôÔ∏è
