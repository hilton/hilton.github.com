## Templates need placeholders

[Document templates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Template_(file_format))
help knowledge workers and other writers create documents from a standard structure,
often with a pre-defined outline’s headings and fixed content.
Template authors typically use a different text colour, or some other styling,
to indicate placeholder text to replace, such as the document title.
The same applies to instruction paragraphs or prompts for what to write below each heading.


## Slite placeholder text

[Slite](https://www.slite.com), a modern collaborative knowledge base,
has a specific text style for template
[placeholders](https://slite.slite.page/p/KXbJIWOOAbo_S_/Untitled).
Slite displays placeholder text in grey with a dotted underline:

![A phrase with placeholders: ‘We (reduce pain / improve life) in (market) by (value proposition).’](slite/template.webp)

However, unlike placeholders in legacy word-processor templates,
Slite placeholders also have a custom interaction:
with the text cursor (anywhere) in the placeholder text,
typing replaces the whole placeholder phrase or paragraph.

For example, after replacing the _improve life_ placeholder,
clicking anywhere in the _market_ placeholder moves the insertion point to its start:

![The insertion point at the start of the placeholder](slite/template-insertion.webp)

Then, typing replaces the placeholder text:

![The placeholder replaced by the typed text](slite/template-replaced.webp)

This results in a lower-friction interaction, and no need to reset text styles afterwards.


## Dynamic collaborative templates

Using a document template to create a new document represents a somewhat old-fashioned example of how someone can help someone else produce a document.
Collaborative writing in teams involves multiple simultaneous authors.

In collaborative writing, authors give each other feedback, as well as writing and editing the text.
You can think of their suggestions for what to write as parts a dynamic template that appear on demand, as the document evolves.


## Good design feels obvious

[Good Design](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/good-design-a89c15136ba6),
according to Julie Zhuo, ‘feels obvious’.
She explains that:

> Obviousness comes from conforming to people’s existing mental models.

Slite’s placeholders feel that kind of obvious,
as if template placeholders couldn’t reasonably work any other way.
However, Zhuo recounts someone telling her how design often works:

> ‘It’s not ever obvious to come up with, though.
> You could be doing months and months of iteration before you come up with that obvious solution.’

Having attended design critique sessions for this kind of user interaction,
I can imagine this applying in Slite’s case too.


## Not yet widely copied

Surprisingly, everyone else hasn’t copied Slite’s placeholder user experience yet.
Perhaps this won’t take too long to also appear in
[Notion templates](https://www.notion.so/help/guides/the-ultimate-guide-to-notion-templates),
for example.
