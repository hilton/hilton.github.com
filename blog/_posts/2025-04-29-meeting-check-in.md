Distributed teams need to build personal connection between team members,
just like co-located teams.
But they don’t do it the same way.
Fully-remote teams develop deliberate practices, such as ‘checking in’ at the start of meetings,
to share human context,
and to get to know each other in small increments.

## Meeting arrival

In an office meeting room, attendees don’t all arrive at the same time,
so you chat while you wait, or read the room.
When someone arrives, their body language gives you a sense of their physical, mental and emotional state.
The physical space creates space for these small interactions, which help build personal connection.

Online meeting organisers typically neglect meeting arrival.
Joining these online meetings disorients you as much as teleporting directly to a meeting room would.
Online meetings need a practice that creates space for _arrival_ and achieves the same opportunities for people to connect.


## Check in

The online meeting _check in_ practice starts every meeting with a question:

{:.big style="max-width:34em"}
> How do you arrive, as a person, right now?

Attendees take turns to answer, typically each sharing a few sentences.
For example:

* ‘I didn’t sleep last night, and I don’t feel so good’
* ‘I just went for a walk in the sun, and I feel great!’
* ‘I’ve had too many meetings today, and feel low-energy’
* ‘I had [just enough time for a satisfying lunch](egg-mayo-sandwich)’
* ‘I skip’ (spoken in introvert-who-needs-to-recharge)

Sometimes one person elects to ‘skip’, and another has a whole story to tell.
Both provide a signal about how someone feels right now.

Talking about ‘how you arrive’ feels weird at first, but quickly becomes a natural way to start a meeting.
More importantly, you immediately get the benefit of knowing what to expect from different people during the meeting.

## Check out

Ending the meeting with a _check out_ mirrors the _check in_, with a similar question:

{:.big.solid-two}
> How do you leave this meeting?

This lets people share more of their personal context, as at the start of the meeting.
You also get two kinds of feedback on the meeting itself.
First, it feels natural to share how you feel compared to the start of the meeting,
whether _energised by the discussion_ or _tired out by concentrating hard_.
Second, the _check out_ can function as a mini-retrospective for the meeting.

## Getting to know each other

Using this check-in practice daily, over a period of months, has a deeper effect.
You pick up details of team members’ lives – family, travel, hobbies, etc. – and get to know each other.
