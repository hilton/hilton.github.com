If you read a lot,
[accumulate unread books](unread-books) so you always have something to read next.
When you do it properly, you’ll have to [get an unread-books bookcase](unread-bookcase)
to accommodate them all.

## The bookcase curation problem

A whole bookcase of unread books gives you plenty of options for what to read next,
but only when you solve the bookcase curation problem.
Without a plan, you end up with a random selection of books you don’t want to read.

A well-curated unread-books bookcase has the same variety as the books you read.
This requires self-reflection, and honesty about the difference between the books you actually read,
and books you want to _have read_.

## Genres

My bookcases cover four genres:

1. my favourite genre
2. guilty pleasures, for easy reading
3. ‘normal’ fiction, to balance the above, and for new discoveries
4. non-fiction.

If you read more than one genre, you’ll need at least one unread option for each one.
Alternating genres and authors gives you easy reading options after a tough read,
while stopping the easy reading’s formulaic writing getting stale.

## Lengths

My unread books include epic trilogies that postpone book completion disappointment.
But sometimes, I only want a short genre detour between longer books.

In each genre, curate a mix of short and long novels, and series.
Choose short novels to avoid getting stuck on one book for too long,
when you don’t have enough time to read.

## Dimensions

I don’t want to take the last fifty pages of a book on holiday.
And when I go on a day trip, I take a slim small-format (178 mm) paperback,
instead of carrying a heavy brick of a book, or an oversized trade paperback.

Books tend to come one shape, but different sizes.
Curate your unread bookcase to include travel-size books,
so you can always have a book to read when you get stuck somewhere.

## Recommendations

My more prolific favourite authors can easily fill my unread bookcase with safe options that I know I will like.
I also need variety, and the occasional new author, though.
Recommendations help with both.

Ask everyone whose taste you respect to recommend the best book they’ve ever read.
Make a list, and don’t forget to write down who recommended each book,
so you can have a fun conversation about it later.
Besides, when you hesitate to take a chance on a new author or genre,
it helps to have someone to talk to about it.
Or blame.

## Random bargains

When I visit the UK, I like browsing charity shops,
such as [The Greenhouse](https://www.guildcare.org/greenhouse) (photo).
Charity shop’s secondhand books typically cost £1–3, occasionally less.
If I get lucky, I find something from my wish list, a recommendation.
And sometimes, I impulse-buy something that adds welcome randomness to my unread bookcase.

[World of Books](https://www.worldofbooks.com/en-gb) offers an online source for used books,
with an explicit [sustainability mission](https://www.worldofbooks.com/en-gb/pages/about-us).
After all, re-use beats recycling, for sustainability.

Bargains reduce the average purchase price,
and setting a maximum price also limits your book accumulation rate.
Therefore, a year’s worth of unread books gives you a buffer 
that lets you buy the books you want more slowly and cheaply, as you find them.
Meanwhile, you can still pay full price for a new book,
when you discover an urgent gap in your unread bookcase.
