In [The Art of Logic](https://profilebooks.com/work/the-art-of-logic/),
Professor Eugenia Cheng presents an accessible introduction to mathematical logic, 
not for its own sake, but in pursuit of better arguments about things we care about.

In this book, Professor Cheng shows how to be _powerfully logical_ rather than unhelpful or antagonistic.
More significantly, she shows how logical arguments relate to emotional arguments, and how to use them more effectively together.

This book incorporates three worthy achievements that many non-fiction books would do well to emulate:

1. Using concrete examples to introduce and explain abstract concepts, all the way through
2. Using important examples that matter
3. Linking two seemingly unrelated topics, in this case logic and emotions

Meanwhile, the book drew me in from the start, by touching on a personal experience.

## Where are the numbers?

Professor Cheng reminds us that schools teach relatively few areas of mathematics, focusing on numbers and geometry, and present mathematics as a tool for science and engineering calculations.
I luckily found my way from school maths to pure mathematics at university, in spite of those conventions.
Explanations like _The Art of Logic_ would have made it easier, and I feel happy for everyone who gets to read it.

More importantly, Professor Cheng challenges the orthodoxy that pure mathematics only exists to support applied mathematics, science and the _numerical_ world.
She brilliantly motivates her work by framing pure mathematics as directly supporting how to think about the _human_ world, which neatly introduces the rest of the book.

As this [XKCD cartoon](https://xkcd.com/55/) illustrates, you can’t use a formula or numbers on an emotional argument.
However, in _The Art of Logic_, Professor Cheng presents two key arguments: logic can not only help with the rational part of an emotional argument, we can use analogies to link logical arguments to human emotions.

## Meaningful examples

Many books about _techniques_ crucially lack a strong motivating example that answers the classic editor question,
_so what and why do I care?_
In this book, Professor Cheng carefully unpicks the weighty topics of misogyny, racism and privilege.
The first part of the book introduces a series of mathematical techniques, and uses them to illuminate different things that people mean when they talk about those subjects.
The results are the most compelling brief introductions to propositional logic, predicate logic, and category theory that I’ve read.

Introductions to logic rarely use more interesting examples than Socrates’ mortality, before discarding these analogies to human affairs and continuing using only symbols.
The result presents an intellectual challenge that quickly becomes a motivation crisis for the reader, as you can experience for yourself by attempting to read the Wikipedia page on
[propositional calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propositional_calculus),
which quickly discards its initial Kansas rainfall examples.

## Category theory for programmers

A few years ago, I witnessed a similar failure to use interesting examples in a conference presentation that introduced category theory to an audience of programmers.
[Category theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_theory),
which examines the the structure of relationships between things and concepts,
lends its concepts to the functional programming community who were attending the conference.
Unfortunately, the presentation consisted largely of diagrams such as the following:

While this diagram usefully represents a particular concept in category theory, I don’t recommend using this approach to introduce the underlying concepts without a single real-world example.
Ironically, that particular programming language community could have really benefitted from _The Art of Logic’s_ analysis of white male privilege.


⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ **Recommended.**
