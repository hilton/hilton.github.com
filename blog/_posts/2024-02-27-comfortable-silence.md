We rarely feel calm and relaxed in meetings at work.
Even regular team meetings can feel forced,
and nothing like an easy conversation among friends.

The presumption of non-stop _talking_ takes over our meetings.	
You probably couldn’t stop talking for even five seconds without someone jumping to fill the gap.

## Awkward silence

In a group setting, silence makes some people feel uncomfortable,
while speech provides continuous structure.
Attendees do need to understand how to follow the meeting and participate,
but that doesn’t have to only mean talking and listening.

Silence during a meeting feels awkward when you feel lost in it, and don’t know what it means.
[Awkward silence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awkward_silence)
doesn’t feel _safe_.

## Dead air

Only exceptional scenarios _require_ continuous talking.
For example, radio broadcasters refer to unintentionally broadcast silence as
[dead air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_air):   

> Among professional broadcasters, dead air is considered one of the worst things that can occur.

As a result, radio DJs master the art of continuous coherence, 
possibly at the cost of not actually saying much.
Fortunately, the teams I know don’t livestream their regular meetings,
and don’t have to worry about this.
Sometimes, we need a break from talking.

## Time to think

We overuse the term _meeting_, for a wide range of group activities,
from news updates to practical workshops.
Sometimes, we use meetings to work on problems together, and need time to:

1. ask questions
2. share ideas
3. _think_.

A lively group discussion helps surface questions and ideas,
but all the talking doesn’t leave much space for thinking and creativity.
Solving problems and discovering new ideas requires individual reflection.
In silence.

## Comfortable silence

Once a team gets used to working together,
they can replace awkward silence with _comfortable silence_.
When team members can share a space without needing someone to talk,
whether in person or online, they have more options for how to work together.

Comfortable silence especially helps distributed teams, 
who otherwise have to explicitly enter or leave an online meeting, start or stop a discussion.
In this sense, comfortable silence typifies several people working quietly in the same ‘room’.
Online, it allows distributed team members to keep a meeting open while they work quietly,
sharing a reassuring presence.

## Psychological safety

Comfortable silence, like so many signs of a healthy team, depends on psychological safety.
Without it, people tend to treat a meeting as a performance, where their colleagues will not accept _dead air_.

Meeting facilitation can help teams who do don’t yet have this.
When a team doesn’t have comfortable silence,
a meeting facilitator can temporarily establish it by setting explicit boundaries:

> I’ve set a timer for five minutes so let’s use that time to write down your ideas in silence.

The next step comes when a team member suggests the same thing, without needing a facilitator, or even expresses their own need for some time, confident that they can ask for it.
