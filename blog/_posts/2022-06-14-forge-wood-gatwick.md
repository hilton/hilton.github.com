![My walking route from Forge Wood to Gatwick](lgw/overview.webp)

On a recent trip, I took an early-morning flight from Gatwick Airport (LGW), South of London.
Instead of arranging transport at an unsociable hour, I visited an old friend who lives in one of the new 
[Forge Wood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forge_Wood) housing estates in Crawley, and left for the airport at dawn.
On foot.

The following sequence of photos shows the 40 minute 3.3 km route walk from Forge Wood to the airport (omitting the first few hundred metres from my friend’s house).
It’s probably possible to shorten this 40 minute 3.3 km route, perhaps by keeping left/West of the reservoirs, on one side of the sewage works or the other.
Maybe next time.

I enjoyed a pleasant walk, through some pretty flower-decked woodland that has survived the encroachment of those outlying airport car parks that you don’t see when you arrive at an airport by train.
I didn’t really _have_ to walk to the airport, but I did appreciate arriving and feeling exceptionally stress-free.

At this point, after my early-morning 40-minute walk, I checked in my heavy rucksack, washed and changed into a clean shirt for the flight, and dumped the old t-shirt I wore for the walk.
And now I don’t have a Scala t-shirt any more.
