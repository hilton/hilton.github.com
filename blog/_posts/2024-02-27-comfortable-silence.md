We rarely feel calm and relaxed in meetings at work.
Even regular team meetings feel forced -
nothing like an easy conversation with friends.

A presumption of non-stop _talking_ has taken over our meetings.	
You couldn’t stop talking for five seconds without someone jumping in.

## Awkward silence

In a group, silence feels uncomfortable, while speech provides structure.
This helps attendees follow the meeting and participate,
but that structure doesn’t have to only come from talking and listening.

Silence during a meeting feels awkward when you feel lost in it, and don’t understand it.
[Awkward silence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Awkward_silence) doesn’t feel _safe_.

## Dead air

Exceptional scenarios _require_ continuous talking.
For example, radio broadcasters avoid the unintentionally broadcast silence
they call ‘[dead air](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_air)’:

{:.big style="max-width:29em"}
> Among professional broadcasters, dead air is considered one of the worst things that can occur.

Fortunately, the teams I know don’t livestream their meetings,
and don’t need DJs’ continuous coherent talking skills.
Instead, we sometimes need a break from talking.

## Time to think

We overuse the term _meeting_ for a range of activities,
from private chats to group workshops.
These different activities have different needs.

When we use meetings to work on problems together, we need time to:

1. ask questions
2. share ideas
3. _think_.

A lively group discussion helps surface questions and ideas,
but all the talking doesn’t leave much space for thinking and creativity.
Solving problems and discovering new ideas requires individual reflection.
In silence.

## Comfortable silence

Once a team gets used to working together,
they can replace awkward silence with _comfortable silence_.
Team members who can share a space without needing someone to talk continously
have more options for how to work together, both in person and online.

When you become comfortable with occasional silence,
you realise how nervous interruptions disrupt meetings.
Too often, the people who _just have to_ comment on everything contribute the least.
Meanwhile, people who take time to reflect what they’ve just heard find it easier to stay on topic,
and stick to a meeting agenda.

Comfortable silence especially helps distributed teams, 
who otherwise have to explicitly enter or leave an online meeting,
to start or stop a discussion.
Comfortable silence feels like several people working together quietly in the same ‘room’.
Online, it allows distributed team members to keep a video call open while they work quietly,
sharing a _reassuring presence_.

## Psychological safety

Comfortable silence, like many signs of a healthy team, requires psychological safety.
Without it, people treat a meeting as a performance, for colleagues who won’t accept _dead air_.

Without psychological safety, nervousness will make itself heard:
nervous laughs and awkward jokes escalate a meeting’s awkwardness factor.	
Without safety no one achieves productivity, let alone their best work.

In the absence of better management, meeting facilitation can help teams get there.
When they don’t have comfortable silence,
a meeting facilitator can temporarily establish it by setting boundaries:

> I’ve set a timer for five minutes so let’s use that time to write down your ideas in silence.

The next step comes when a team member suggests this without the facilitator, 
or even confidently expresses their own need for time to think, instead of overthinking the silence.

My former colleague, Maya Nedeljkovich, put it best: ‘psychological safety is the difference between an awkward silence and a comfortable one’.
