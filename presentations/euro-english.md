Software developers in Europe inevitably work on international teams and adopt a
[Euro English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro_English) dialect.
Euro English works surprisingly well, much to the annoyance of native English speakers.
What’s less obvious are the subtle ways that Euro English can introduce both software and development-process bugs.

Language issues belong to software architects because _architecture is communication_. 
The concepts you build software with, and the words you use, shape a system as much as the software components you use.
Architects design how developers _talk about_ a system as much as they design how developers _build_ one.

This talk introduces a collection of language-related software development gotchas that have little to do with how good your English is.
You’ll learn what ‘business English’ is for, whether to translate domain model terms into English, and what you should do about ‘trainings’ not being a proper English word.
You’ll also become equipped to recognise previously invisible problems, and new ways for your whole team to improve.
