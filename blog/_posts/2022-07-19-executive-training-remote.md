The changing nature of work in remote workplaces finds companies’ most senior employees struggling to adapt to new working practices.
These employees face tough challenges as their interactions shift dramatically from in-person face-to-face verbal exchanges to written online conversations.
Every day, power moves from corner offices to chat rooms and channels.

A new series of one-day training courses provides modern executives with the skills they need to operate effectively in today’s remote work landscape.
These skills enable senior leaders to translate their charisma and influence to where the work happens now.
A recognised expert in the topic will deliver each course, bringing real-world industry experience and a track record of live presentations/performances.
