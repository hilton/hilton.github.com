Product people sometimes play a game called _product tsundoku_,
in which you collect feature ideas and let them pile up without implementing them.
Product tsundoku derives from Japanese [tsundoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsundoku),
a similar game that you play with
[books you haven’t read](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/e2aa594f-91c0-4ed5-a145-15cd9aba6f9b).

## How to play

To play _product tsundoku_, you need a steady source of product ideas.
Vague ideas about how to improve the product, such as ongoing user experience improvements or
[fixing bugs](zero-bug-policy) won’t do.
Nor will identifying customer problems: _product tsundoku_ requires concrete feature ideas.
In fact, in colloquial usage, the term _tsundoku_ also refers to a [feature backlog](infinite-backlog).

Gameplay consists of deriving as much satisfaction as possible from the feature backlog,
_without actually implementing the features_.
That way, ‘your’ features remain more perfect than they could ever actually become.

Using a software tool to glorify the feature backlog goes without saying.
You can also schedule weekly _ceremonies_ to keep it front-of-mind.

## How to win

You cannot win a game of _product tsundoku_ in the usual sense, because you cannot complete the game.
However, some elements of competitive gameplay remain.

* **One-upmanship** – having a better _tsundoku_ that other teams; see [The Theory And Practice Of Gamesmanship; Or, The Art Of Winning Games Without Actually Cheating](https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/f0b1b66f-f024-474c-9a93-9ee1918eef6e) (1947)
* **Over-promising** – continually trolling the sales team by promising features, but never working on them. Include release dates to increase the stakes, especially in B2B SaaS.
* **Strategy-avoidance** – using the _tsundoku_ to avoid talking about business goals, or a decision-framework for deciding which product development work will contribute to them (first person to say _objective_ loses!)
* **Assigning points** – in an improvisational-comedy sub-game, reminiscent of [Mornington Crescent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mornington_Crescent_(game)), players assign so-called _story points_ to features.

In general, you win at _product tsundoku_ when other players think you have a more impressive product roadmap.
In a company with more than one product, you can often compete against other product managers in a regular tournament, called a _quarterly business review_.

## Causes

Product people play _product tsundoku_ for various reasons,
but principally because they enjoy fantasising that their customers need nothing more than _more features_.
At the same time, actual software development only gets in the way,
like rain that stops play in cricket or tennis, and never seems to end.

Features naturally accumulate, because you can imagine and describe a feature in far less time than it takes to build,
especially if you skip customer research and user experience design.
It also helps that you can write implausible user stories, instead of stories that real people might actually tell each other.

## Counter-game

Planning any kind of [quarterly objectives](quarterly-objectives)
subverts the endless game of _product tsundoku_.
Although you only _complete_ product development by decommissioning the product,
establishing a new focus for each new calendar quarter gives team members a sense of closure.

_Avant garde_ product people reject _product tsundoku_, and play a counter-game
called _Objectives & Key Results_ (OKRs).
Many people consider this completely unfair.
