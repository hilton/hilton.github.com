The software design dead zone lies between functionality that product owners prioritise,
and technical design that developers care about.
What’s the wrong sort order?
Is this email address really valid?
How does this API report errors?
Stranded design questions leave teams and their software with bad decisions and flawed user experience, data models, and APIs.

This talk for architects, product owners and developers explores which group feels responsible for which kind of design decision, on the spectrum from functional to technical.
Attendees will discover software architecture’s role in providing the technical leadership on software design.
