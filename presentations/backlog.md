Your development backlog is too big.
And while a long list of planned development work may feel reassuring,
the backlog isn’t true and it’s not worth it.
Shrinking your backlog cuts down on boring meetings, gives your team more flexibility,
and makes development leaner, smoother and faster.
Shrinking backlogs makes developers happier.

In this session, attendees will learn techniques to reduce development backlog size.
You’ll learn how to move feature requests and roadmaps elsewhere,
defer requirements and designs until you need them,
and have more time to improve the user experience.
Whatever your role and level, you can help simplify how your team works.
