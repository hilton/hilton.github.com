[productboard](https://www.productboard.com/) - product management SaaS - lets you manage:

* [product backlogs](productboard-product-backlog-review)
* customer feedback _(this review)_
* [roadmaps](productboard-roadmaps-review)
* customer portals.

In productboard, the 
[Insights board](https://help.productboard.com/en/articles/260210-5-insights-understand-what-users-need)
collects customer feedback _notes_ from various sources, so you can capture a large volume of feedback.
Best of all, you can link specific text from each note to product backlog items, to create customer demand visibility.

## Collecting and organising feedback

I started using productboard more than six months ago to collect customer feedback, with two goals in mind: _capture everything_ and _create transparency within the organisation_.
productboard has performed well on both counts.

productboard calls each product feedback item a _note_, which you post on the _Insights board_.
A note might come from a colleague, a forwarded customer email, customer meeting minutes, a support request, or an online conversation.
Wanting to capture _everything_ means making it as easy as possible for as many people as possible.
productboard helps by making it possible to create a note:

* in the web interface
* via email
* using a Chrome plugin
* from a Slack message.

One annoyance: you can’t bookmark a URL for adding a note.
I had to write instructions that link to the insights board, and then describe which button to click on a busy page.

Once you have lots of notes, you get to tag them, and assign them to _owners_ who find notes in their inbox, until they mark them _processed_.
As with the product backlog, searching, tags and saved filters help this scale up to lots of data.
Once you have these notes in your inbox, you get to use the productboard feature I like most: linking to the product backlog.

## Linking feedback to the product backlog

In each note, you can highlight text, and link to the product backlog, to record customer demand for the feature.
The link itself, called an _insight_, captures additional data: a reference to an _organisation_ or _user_, and the _importance_ for that customer.
I love linking the product backlog to customer feedback:
then the features board shows a _user impact score_ - the number of customers with linked _insights_, which I use for prioritisation.

In this screenshot, the highlighted text links to a product backlog item: _Show kittens sidebar_, say.

Company and user linking cleverly uses a company’s Internet domain and user email addresses to automatically associate users with companies.
This makes it easy to find existing users and companies, so you don’t add duplicates.
You can also find a user or company in productboard, and list their insights before your next meeting.

## Conclusion

productboard shows its value when you integrate customer feedback with 
[product backlogs](productboard-customer-feedback-review).
Multiple ways to add feedback help you get more feedback from more people, and tools like _owners, followers, tagging_ and _collections_ help organise the resulting feedback torrent.
As hoped, productboard made it possible to _capture everything_, and using the product backlog to organise and count this feedback helped _create transparency within the organisation_.

I’ve seen simpler and more usable product management tools, but in the future I will certainly compare their customer feedback capabilities to productboard’s.
Meanwhile, you still need to consider how you want to [manage and share roadmaps](productboard-roadmaps-review).
