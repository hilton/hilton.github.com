Code style matters, but not only in the way you think. Programmers famously waste time arguing indentation styles, while whole teams lack a consistent vision for their code style, and consistent code. This talk highlights what really matters, and what you need to learn to write code with vision and style.

Attendees will learn about how things like formatting, writing idiomatic code, naming, and coding paradigms affect code style. Youâ€™ll also learn about concrete approaches to developing a team coding style, including code review, style guides, and automation. Good coding style matters, and is the key to team productivity and code longevity.
