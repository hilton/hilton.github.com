If you have a cool product idea, you might as well share it for the entertainment value, because
[you shouldn’t expect anyone to pay you for just an idea](startup-ideas-are-cheap).

## Joke research

Social media makes it easier to share good jokes without credit, than to credit the original author.
Solve the problem of parasitic people benefiting from engagement farming without sharing their fifteen seconds of fame with creative people.
Instead, make it easy to find the earliest publication of a particular joke,
and build it into social media platforms so they automatically link unoriginal rip-offs to the original,
such as [this much-copied classic](https://x.com/marcusbrig/status/1119168315992076288) 
by comedian Marcus Brigstocke:

> People say kids are affected by computer games...
> 
> If we’d been influenced by the computer games from our childhood
> we’d all be running round in darkened rooms, munching pills and listening to repetitive music.
> 
> (Funnier to let the audience figure out the Pac Man bit).

## Writing

Everyone needs to write, and most people find it difficult, annoying, or both.
Only _writers_ actually like it.
Solve the problem of writing's difficulty, by creating writers with AI, instead of replacing them,
with a different kind of AI writing tool.
The tool prompts _you_ with ideas for what to write next, when you stop writing,
instead of you having to prompt the AI and have it get all the glory.

## Business software

People who choose or use business software (B2B SaaS) want to switch to something better,
sooner or later, but often find it hard to migrate to a new tool.
Solve the problem of no [credible exit](https://subconscious.substack.com/p/credible-exit),
and make it easier for software vendors to get competitive advantage from actually having one.
For example, make it easy to expose all application data as
[CSVW files](csvw) via the [Git server](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git#Git_server) protocol,
to enable export and data synchronisation.

## Business writing software

Writers don’t always know what length of writing their audience wants to read,
and the same audience might want more or less detail, depending on context.
Solve the document length problem that results from this tension between wanting more detail,
and having a limited context-dependent attention span.
For example, build a document viewer that automatically adjusts document/summary length to the reader’s predicted attention span in different circumstances.

## Business calendar software

Managers often have a regular one-on-one meeting with each of their direct reports.
In organisations that work asynchronously and minimise meetings,
these one-on-ones and peers’ _virtual coffees_ may account for most recurring meetings.
Solve the problem that calendar software treats these the same as group meetings,
and expects a fixed title that describes the meeting the same way for everyone,
while _One-on-one with Peter_ only works for one of the two attendees.
For example, add a special _one-on-one_ meeting type to calendar software
that automatically sets the meeting event title to the other attendee’s name.
