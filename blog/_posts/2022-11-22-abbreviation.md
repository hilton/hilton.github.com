*[HTTP]: hypertext transfer protocol - a network application protocol
*[MVP]: minimum viable product - a product development technique
*[OKR]: objectives and key results - a planning technique
*[PM]: product manager
*[PoC]: proof of concept
*[RACI]: responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed - a project roles framework
*[SWOT]: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats - a risk management framework
*[URL]: uniform resource locator - a web site’s address

Technical writing in a specific subject domain often suffers from poor readability.
Abbreviations harm readability, along with other problems, because they introduce ambiguity outside closed audience groups who share a common domain language.

You need a plan for abbreviations that accounts for your audience.
If you like modelling then, as part of this plan, you may want to model different kinds of abbreviations.
And while you might know the difference between an _initialism_ and an _acronym_, you might miss the more important distinction between jargon and laziness.

| **Lazy** | PM | PoC* |
| **Jargon** | MVP, OKR | RACI, SWOT |

\* if you pronounce it _pock_

## Acronyms, initialisms, and other abbreviations

An _initialism_ abbreviates a phrase with its initial letters, which you pronounce as individual letters, such as _PM_ for _product manager_.
An _acronym_ also abbreviates a phrase with its initial letters, but you pronounce it as a single word, especially for acronyms like _SWOT_
([strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis))
that have the same spelling as a word.

[Abbreviations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbreviation) also include contractions, which shorten one or more words by omitting letters, as in _etc._ for _et cetera_, and _don’t_ for _do not_.
Unfortunately, these categorisations don’t help with writing and written style guides.
In good writing, avoid _lazy_ abbreviations.

## Don’t use lazy abbreviations in writing

Some abbreviations provide a shorthand in writing or speaking, to save typing or syllables.
Something like _PM_ works well enough in a spoken context, when you know this won’t cause any _product manager_ vs _project manager_ confusion among your current audience.
Writing, however, reaches other people at other times, and leads to ambiguity.

Don’t use lazy abbreviations in writing.
Write _product manager_ out in full, to make your writing easier and faster to read.
It doesn’t matter what you write in notes that no-one else will read.
But as soon as you write for other people, prioritising the reader improves your writing.

Definitely don’t make up your own abbreviations, which non-native English speakers can’t even look up in a dictionary.
When new abbreviations do appear, that happens in a group context, resulting in shared jargon.

## Don’t expand jargon abbreviations

An initialism like _URL_ works differently to lazy abbreviations.
If you don’t know what _URL_ means, then you probably don’t know what _Uniform Resource Locator_ means either.
Similarly, when explanation of URLs mentions _HTTP resources_, if you don’t know what _HTTP_ means,
expanding that to _Hypertext Transfer Protocol_ probably doesn’t help.

_MVP_ has the same kind of problem.
You don’t resolve an argument about what qualifies as an MVP by explaining the terms _minimum_, _viable_ and _product_.
Eric Ries wrote [a whole book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lean_Startup)
about the concept, and people still argue about it.

Some abbreviations and their expansions both belong to the same jargon.
Within their domain, expanding them doesn’t add any clarity, 
while readers outside the domain need explanations instead of expansion.
Instead of digressing into an explanation of HTTP resources, you could describe a URL as
_the unique address for a web site, or other Internet resource_,
or _a web site’s unique address_, depending on the context.
