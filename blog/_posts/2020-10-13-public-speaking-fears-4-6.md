To overcome your [fear of public speaking](public-speaking-fear) by presenting, you need to figure out how to stop it blocking you.
This article continues from the first [three fears of public speaking](public-speaking-fears-1-3).

| Fear of public speaking | How to opt out of the situation | Mitigation
| --- | --- | ---
| 1. [Bad presentation](public-speaking-fears-1-3#fear1) | Low-stakes casual meet-up | Do a trial run to get trusted feedback
| 2. [No potential topic](public-speaking-fears-1-3#fear2) | Choose your favourite topic | Ask your friends what you know about
| 3. [Boring topic](public-speaking-fears-1-3#fear3) | Let the event organiser choose | Brainstorm ideas with the organisers
| 4. [Too little to say](#fear4) | Limit presentation length | Discuss the topic and make notes
| 5. [Level too basic ](#fear5)| Let event organisers choose | Introduce it as a refresher
| 6. [Unpredictable length](#fear6) | Allow for 15-30 minutes | Practice a fixed duration per slide

<h2 id="fear4">Fear 4: too little to say</h2>

Inexperienced presenters who haven’t tried to write a presentation may assume that they won’t have enough content to fill more than a couple of slides.
In practice, presenters tend to transition quickly from _I have nothing to say_ to _OMG I have 400 slides!_

Only having two slides might not matter, though. Many events accommodate short talks, so start by aiming to write a ten-minute presentation, and in the unlikely even that you don’t end up with more than that, tell the organisers that you only have a lightning talk.

Meanwhile, to find out whether you can elaborate on your chosen topic, practice in one-on-one conversations and make a note of the questions people ask.
The three to five most interesting questions can become the presentation outline.
You only get to do a lightning talk instead of a 30-45 minute presentation if you only discover one question.


<h2 id="fear5">Fear 5: level too basic</h2>

Inexperienced speakers wrongly assume that only experts give presentations, and that they shouldn’t present introductory content.
Again, event organisers know that most communities include more beginners than experts, and that new joiners want to learn the basics, so tell them that you have a presentation for beginners, and let them choose.

Meanwhile, experts welcome a refresher on topics adjacent to their expertise that they should probably know more about than they do.
Whatever your topic, most experts specialise in something _else_.
And any experts in your exact topic will love seeing a beginner promoting _their_ favourite topic, and will encourage anyone who shows any kind of interest in it.
Besides, they probably already gave plenty of introductory talks on the subject, and would much rather someone else do them now.

<h2 id="fear6">Fear 6: unpredictable length</h2>

Sadly, the _fear of having too much to say_ deters too few presenters, who then go on to lecture tired evening audiences for over an hour.
Audiences hate presentations that overrun, however much they loved the first half.
Start with a short presentation, and check that the meet-up organiser is happy with anything from fifteen to 30 minutes.

Meanwhile, practice with a fixed duration per slide, so you get used to a constant pace that keeps the length relatively predictable as you add slides.
If you don’t know where to start, assume one minute per slide if you use bullet points, or half that if your slides don’t include any text.
