I recently found myself looking for an alternative to the term _PRD_
([product requirements document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_requirements_document)),
for product people who don’t like abbreviations, and who think product discovery identifies _opportunities_, 
not _requirements_.

Depending on your point of view, getting naming Just Right either wastes time, 
or provides valuable framing that you will benefit from daily for a long time to come.
My personal interest in [naming things](/tag/naming) dates back [nine years](/presentations/naming),
so it shouldn’t surprise you to find me overthinking this particular question.

## The PRD mistake

Software product management generally deals with _making choices_, not _defining requirements_.
Each industry and product category has genuine requirements, often legal requirements, 
that you recognise because they apply equally to your competitors.
Instead of calling it a _PRD_, at least pick a more honest name, like **product choice rationalisation**.

Meanwhile, I also don’t like the term _PRD_ because I don’t like [lazy abbreviations](abbreviation).
In product management especially, you communicate with people in many groups, 
who have different daily jargon and potentially conflicting abbreviations.
In writing, even for internal stakeholders, avoid abbreviations.

## One-pagers

John Cutler calls these documents
[one-pagers](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/great-one-pagers-592ebbaf80ec),
to emphasise conciseness that he calls ‘crisp communication’.
This name works in the context of [writing extensively](https://cutlefish.substack.com/archive)
for product managers, about product management techniques and frameworks.

As a product manager working with other teams, 
you might not get away with the arrogance of claiming such a generic term.
Alternatively, **product docs** avoids the ambiguity, 
provided that you don’t use the term _documentation_ for user guides and manuals.
Similarly, developers and support teams often refer to _tickets_ that describe every kind of work they get via an
[incident ticket system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Issue_tracking_system).
Personally, though, I prefer not to name documents according to their length or database.

## Opportunities

When product managers talk about product discovery, we typically refer to the _problem space_.
However, talking about **problems** forces us to include _problems the customer didn’t know they had_,
which feels awkward (and patronising).
The term _opportunity_ has the advantage of including more than just customers’ _problems_.
In [Continuous Discovery Habits](product-management-books), Teresa Torres writes:

> I’ll refer to customer needs, pain points, and desires collectively as “opportunities”—they represent opportunities to intervene in our customers’ lives in a positive way.

We can therefore refer to our discovery write-ups as **opportunity descriptions**,
whose accuracy unfortunately makes it a boring term with too many syllables won’t catch on.
In practice, you can probably just use the term **opportunity** for the document that describes one, 
rather than the opportunity itself.

This is the same kind of [category error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_mistake)
we got used to from people asking each other to _create issues_ 
(in [Jira](https://support.atlassian.com/jira-software-cloud/docs/what-is-an-issue/)).
I can live with that, and like _opportunity_, but would prefer a shorter word.

## Bets

Annie Duke popularised **bets**, as concise alternatives to _opportunities_, in her book,
[Thinking in Bets](https://www.annieduke.com/books/).
In the context of discovery and roadmap prioritisation, _bet_ abbreviates the idea of 
_my bet… were I to actually place it_, rather than a bet you’ve already made, 
so you can use it for bets you decline to prioritise.

John Cutler also actually defines [one-pagers](https://medium.com/@johnpcutler/great-one-pagers-592ebbaf80ec) as:

> short, space-constrained, descriptions of a proposed product bet

I like short names, but not everyone will enjoy the gambling reference.
Furthermore, talking about _placing bets_ requires enough trust and safety to acknowledge product management decision uncertainty.
