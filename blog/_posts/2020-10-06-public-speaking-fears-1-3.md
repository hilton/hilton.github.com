To overcome your [fear of public speaking](public-speaking-fear] by presenting, you need to figure out how to stop it blocking you.
First, identify individual blockers, so you can opt out of the situations that create them.
Then you can work on giving a successful presentation without worrying about those problems.
After all, if presenting becomes a habit, you can address your fears later, one at a time.

| Fear of public speaking | How to opt out of the situation | Mitigation
| --- | --- | ---
| 1. Bad presentation | Low-stakes casual meet-up | Trial run
| 2. No potential topic | Choose your favourite topic | Ask your friends
| 3. Boring topic | Let the event organiser choose | Brainstorm ideas

## Fear 1: giving a bad presentation

If you’ve never presented before, you might worry about giving a bad presentation.
To avoid the _right-first-time_ trap, pick a venue where a bad presentation wouldn’t really matter:
a small meet-up, instead of a big conference or an important meeting at work.
Meanwhile, you can make a bad presentation less likely by doing a trial run for someone whose feedback you trust.

## Fear 2: no potential topic

I once talked to a junior developer at a conference in Poland, who assumed that juniors don’t have anything to present.
It only took me a minute to discover that she’d switched from astrophysics a year earlier.
Personally, I’d want to hear any software presentation with ‘astrophysics’ in the title, and anyone with a year’s software development experience has learned something interesting or useful that most other people don’t know yet.

Everyone has a unique story to tell, and everyone can teach you something you didn’t already know, especially in diverse technology communities.
Novice presenters fear that they don’t have anything to say, but fail to recognise their own background’s uniqueness.
You probably know which topic you would love to talk about if someone asked you to, so make that your first presentation.
And if you don’t trust your instinct, your friends will happily tell you what you love to go on about.

## Fear 3: boring topic

Maybe your friends only tell you to stop going on about your favourite topic because they’ve heard about it enough times, not because they didn’t find it interesting the first time.
Fortunately, you don’t need to know whether people will find your topic interesting, because someone else already has that particular responsibility.

Don’t decide other people will find interesting: let the event organisers decide.
If they accept your presentation topic, they share responsibility for its success with their audience, who they probably know better than you do.
Besides, maybe struggle with repetitive events and want something off-topic.
Either way, if they brainstorm ideas with you, you all get to know both you and the audience better.

## Conclusion: lean on the organisers

Fear of public speaking partly comes from what you don’t know and can’t control.
Fortunately, as a beginner, you can focus on your first presentation and let someone else worry about organising a good event.
