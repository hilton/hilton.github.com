The submission guidelines for 
[97 Things Every Java Programmer Should Know](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920048824.do)
introduced me to writing about a topic with a strict 450-550 word limit.
At first I found this difficult, but worthwhile.
Then I learned how to make it easier, and discovered a welcome side-benefit.

## Short enough to focus and finish

While commercial writing imposes word limits, writing on a personal blog frees you from other people’s constraints.
However, a word limit helps keeps you focused.
500 words only gives you enough ‘space’ to write about one thing.

When I started writing weekday blog posts in July 2014, I often ended up with around 800 words, as a result of starting on a topic and following threads that I uncovered.
This resulted in half-written articles that I found difficult to finish, either because of loose ends that I couldn’t wrap up quickly, or because I didn’t have time to follow all of them.
Those articles took _hours_.

## Less editing, more planning

More recently, aiming for 500 words gave me a new problem: editing to length.
The first time I tried this, my first draft arrived at around 800 words, as usual.
Editing to remove a third of it no doubt improved the end result, but it felt painful to delete so many whole sentences and paragraphs.
I needed to plan better.

By the third article, I already had a reasonable idea about how much space I would have, and the first draft got me much closer to the target.
I achieved this by starting from an outline.

## Using an outline to plan

[Get Better at Naming Things](97-things-naming), 
the first of three articles that I wrote to a 550 word limit,
consists of a series of statements and advice for programmers (which
[product backlog naming tips](product-backlog-naming-tips) adapts for product people):

1. Better naming improves your code
2. Avoid bad names
3. Adopt naming guidelines
4. Compromise on 2-4 words
5. Use domain language
6. Enlarge your vocabulary
7. Name your types
8. Don’t mix class and object names
9. Decide when to break the rules

I started the third article with a similar ten-point outline, then expanded each one into a short paragraph.
This way, I avoided starting on topics that I wouldn’t have space to write about, and hit the word count target first time.

Since then, I discovered that reducing the outline from ten points to give creates space for examples.
Technical writing often suffers from too few good examples.
And jokes.

## Weekly posts

After not publishing any blog posts in 2019, I resumed blogging in 2020.
It turns out that the strict word limit makes it a lot easier to keep up a weekly schedule.
By limiting each article’s scope, first in the outline, and again while writing and editing, I finish each one in less time, making it easier to average more than one post per week.

When planning fails, and I can see that I’ll go beyond the word limit, I’ve learned to extract a topic into its own article.
That way I can mention a topic, and go into more detail in the next post.
In the end, by writing less, I publish more.

_First draft: 542 words_
