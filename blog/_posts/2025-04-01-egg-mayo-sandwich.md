## Goals

This recipe provides the optimisations that other egg mayonnaise sandwich recipes lack. 

1. Minimise time-to-sandwich.
2. Minimise washing up.

To achieve these goals, you will only make a single generous serving.

## Ingredients

* 1 egg
* 15 g mayonnaise
* 2 slices of white sourdough bread
* freshly-ground black pepper
* garden cress

## Equipment

* boiling water tap
* [moka pot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moka_pot)
* dessert spoon
* butter/spreading knife
* fork
* small smooth chopping board
* kitchen scales
* stove

## Boiling

Reduce the time to starting to boil the egg by boiling less water.
Pour boiling water into a moka pot base, to cover the egg, and put it on the stove:

Cover the pot with the (inverted) moka pot basket, to retain heat,
so you can achieve and maintain boiling temperature with less power:

The water should return to the boil within 90 seconds, then continue boiling it for a further 8 minutes.

Use the spoon to remove the egg, and keep it in place in the sink, while you run it under cold water for 20 seconds:

This stops the egg cooking, makes it cool enough to peel, and possibly easier to peel.

## Mixing

Peel the egg.
Put the chopping board on the scales, weight 15 g of mayonnaise, and add the other ingredients:

Use the fork to mash and mix the ingredients together:

## Assembly

Use the spreading knife to scrape the mixture onto the bread from the board,
which takes less time to scrape clean than a round mixing bowl:

## Alternative ingredients

![A generous helping of rocket instead of garden cress](egg-mayo/rocket.webp)

* **Japanese mayonnaise and thick-sliced white bread** for a simpler flavour, like a [tamago sando](https://umamipot.com/tamago-sando/)
* **wholemeal or seeded bread** instead of white bread, for a more complex flavour
* **white pepper** instead of black pepper
* **rocket** instead of garden cress

## Tradeoffs

You get boiling water fastest if you fill the moka pot directly from a **boiling wqter tap**,
while a **kettle** costs less and you can travel with one.

Adding **salt** to the water allegedly makes the egg easier to peel,
but **without salt** makes less of a mess if you spill the water.

You can measure mayonnaise from **squeezy bottle** or tube faster,
but using the knife to get it from a **glass jar** avoids single-use plastic packaging.

**Kitchen scales** cost more than a **measuring spoon**, but avoid one more utensil to wash up.

The **fork** makes it easy to mash the egg, 
but if you chop the egg with the **knife**, you don’t need the fork.

## Further optimisations

Other potential time and ingredients optimisations require further testing.

* Boil the egg from room temperature, instead of fridge temperature.
* Reduce egg cooling time, so cooking continues until egg-mashing, you can further reduce boiling time.
* Reduce cooking time to _barely-hardboiled_, so you can reduce the amount of mayonnaise.
* Boil the egg in a kettle, so you don’t need a stove.
* Slice the egg directly onto the bread, instead of mashing it, so you don’t need the board.
