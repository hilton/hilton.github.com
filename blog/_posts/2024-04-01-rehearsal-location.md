Choir rehearsals feature many musical stops and starts.
While singers enjoy singing pieces from start to finish, conductors have to stop and fix what’s wrong, by asking for something better.
Again and again.
Efficient rehearsal relies on quickly an accurately telling a group of singers where to restart from, without discussion.

## Homophony

In some music, such as hymns, everyone sings more or less the same thing at (more or less) the same time.
When multiple voice parts sing different notes, we call this
[homophony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homophony).

For example, in the sixteenth century [chorale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chorale), 
_Aus tiefer Not schrei' ich zu Dir_
([CPDL #79638](https://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Aus_tiefer_Not_schrei%27_ich_zu_Dir_%28Sixt_Dietrich%29)),
four voice parts sing each word and syllable together:

![Excerpt from a chorale score](aus-tiefer-not.webp) <em style="left:400px">‘Was Sünd und Unrecht’</em>

With this style of music, the conductor can stop the choir and ask them to
‘start again from (the phrase in the text) _Was Sünd und Unrecht_’ (red line, above).
If the conductor can read the tiny bar number above the first bar in this system,
they could also count along from bar 22, and ask for the second half of bar 29.

Note: singers don’t all sing from electronic displays that display a dynamic conductor-controlled red marker.
Not yet, anyway.

## Polyphony

[Renaissance polyphony](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony) 
makes it harder to find a convenient place to start,
especially when you have six voice parts that all start a phrase at different times.
In polyphony, different voice parts may sing more or less the same phrases, but typically not at the same time,
as in this excerpt from the end of
[Manuel Cardoso’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manuel_Cardoso_(composer)) _Missa Pro Defunctis_
([CPDL #36844](https://www.cpdl.org/wiki/index.php/Missa_Pro_Defunctis_%28Manuel_Cardoso%29)):

![Excerpt from a renaissance polyphony score, with numbered bars](missa-pro-defunctis.webp)

If you want to go back to this part of the score, there are several options for where to start.
Each part starts each phrase in a different place, so you probably want to start where _one_ of the six voice parts starts the text _cum sanctis tuis_.
This goes wrong because it’s not obvious which part goes first.

## Underlay

Chaos ensues when the conductor ignores the bar numbers and tells 24 singers, ‘let’s start again from _cum sanctis_’.

![Excerpt from a renaissance polyphony score, with numbered bars](missa-pro-defunctis.webp)
<em class="part" style="left:134px; top:79px;"></em>
<em class="part" style="left:55px; top:39px;"></em>
<em class="part" style="left:241px; top:39px;"></em>
<em class="part" style="left:10px; top:15px;"></em>
<em class="part" style="left:119px; top:211px;"></em>

1. Half the choir only looks at the top three lines, and assumes that the second soprano part (S2) starts first, in bar 22.
2. Several people heard someone say ‘bar 22’, but they mistake the page number (top-left) for the bar number, and think bar 22 is the first bar of the page, not the second.
3. The first sopranos (S1) think it’s all about them, so they’re looking at bar 23.
4. Several people are still on the previous page, where _cum sanctis tuis_ first appears.
5. The tenors only correctly think the conductor wants to start at their entry (T) at end of bar 22 by accident, because they only have the phrase _cum sanctis tuis_ once on this page.
6. The basses, meanwhile, are still talking amongst themselves.

Using the underlay (text) to navigate fails hard in this musical style, 
because text phrases typically repeat, spread over many musical phrases.

## Bar number and beat

Bar numbers solve the navigation problem, in theory.

![Excerpt from a renaissance polyphony score, with numbered bars](missa-pro-defunctis.webp) <em style="left:118px">bar 21, second beat</em>

A conductor might describe this location as:

* **bar 21, third beat**, if they count four in a bar, as in modern music
* **bar 21, second beat** (halfway), counting two in a bar, more appropriately for this style
* **bar 22** (meaning the upbeat before the start of the bar)

Ideally, your conductor would be consistent, and the singers would get used to one interpretation.
Alternatively, the conductor remove the ambiguity.

## Bar number and voice part

Specifying this same location as **the tenor entry at bar 21** adds some redundant information to remove the ambiguity:

![Excerpt from a renaissance polyphony score, with numbered bars](missa-pro-defunctis.webp) <em style="left:118px">the tenor entry at bar 21</em>

Singers will understand that the tenor part (T) should be starting a phrase, and will find the intended location in the bar specified.

## Start of the system

A less conventional (chaotic good) conductor might opt out of this whole problem by only ever picking up from 
**the start of the system** - bar 21 in this example - where most scores show a bar number
(as in the _Aus tiefer Not schrei' ich zu Dir_ excerpt, top):

![Excerpt from a renaissance polyphony score, with numbered bars](missa-pro-defunctis.webp) <em style="left:55px">start of the system</em>

In this approach, at least one part has a straightforward starting note, such as the F for the bass part (B).
The conductor assumes that the tenor part will start the phrase _cum sanctis tuis_ at the end of the first bar,
and the other parts will join in as soon as they can, no later than their next _cum sanctis tuis_.
This unmusical entry in the middle of a phrase makes life more difficult for the singers,
but they can get used to it, and it saves a lot of time and confusion.

## Rehearsal mark

Messing about with bar numbers over-complicates things.
This sixteenth musical style pre-dates bar lines and bar numbers anyway,
and some conductors and singers prefer to sing renaissance polyphony from scores without bar lines:

![Excerpt from a renaissance polyphony score, with a rehearsal mark, and without bar lines](missa-pro-defunctis-rehearsal-mark.webp) <em style="left:112px">tenor entry at A</em>

Without bars to number, you need explicit _rehearsal marks_ for navigation, such as the **A**, above.
Preparing scores for rehearsal like this narrows the number of possible starting locations to two or three per page,
and means that everyone will be on the same page when the conductor asks the choir to start from
‘**the tenor entry at A**’.
If only everyone were that well-prepared.
