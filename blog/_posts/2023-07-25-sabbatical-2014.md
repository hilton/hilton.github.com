In 2014, I had the opportunity to spend six months in London.
I once lived in Paris for six months, and figured that I should try London now I had the chance.
I’d enjoyed Paris, but ultimately found the lifestyle unsustainable, and suspected that a limited period in London would also suit me.

## Follow an opportunity

It seemed reasonable to propose working remotely, but my employer didn’t see it that way.
Meanwhile, my [first sabbatical](sabbatical-2004) ten years earlier made me optimistic about the value of taking another.
I reasoned that I would get more from the opportunity than from staying put, so I quit my job and went.

I made a good decision, despite the uncertainty, because I could afford the risks.
What I didn’t expect was how energised I would feel from choosing a new adventure.
It turned out that having enough savings to take six months off work coincided with being too stuck in a routine, and gaining new energy from the change.

## Escalate a hobby

Throughout my sabbatical, I indulged in my hobby, [singing early music](/music/).
I used my free time to join more workshops, groups and performances than I’d previously had access to,
in the Netherlands’ quieter early music scene.
This escalated to joining [The Renaissance Singers](https://www.renaissancesingers.com), 
a choir at a higher level than I’d ever experienced before.

Doubling down on a hobby took at least as much time and focus as studying Spanish in Madrid during my 
[previous sabbatical](sabbatical-2004).
As before, I got a lot of satisfaction from improving my skills, despite their lack of obvious professional relevance.
At the same time, I was also inspired to advance my software development career.

## Get a job interview by networking

Living near [Silicon Roundabout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_London_Tech_City) 
in London presented excellent professional networking opportunities.
London offered a dozen tech meet-ups every day, including lunchtime events, so I went to one most days.
I met a lot of interesting people with interesting jobs at these events, and chose a goal for my sabbatical to capitalise on the conversations there:
_get a new job without writing a CV_.

One opportunity arose from a chance meeting at a conference I wasn’t attending, while looking for a 
[London Java Community](https://www.londonjavacommunity.co.uk) 
meet-up at the venue that I never found.
A conversation with a conference vendor led to dinner, a conversation about automation, and a trip to Berlin for a job interview.

## Get a job by blogging

Since my previous sabbatical, I’d spent the last ten years increasing the amount of writing I did at work,
including writing my employer’s marketing web site.
I missed writing for myself, though, so when I started the sabbatical, I got started on a a long backlog of blog post titles that had never suited the company tech blog.
I published a [blog post](/blog/) most weekdays for the first couple of months, July-September 2014.

Writing about software introduced me to B2B content marketing.
A conversation about that with a previouus acquaintance led to writing three articles about his prodcut in exchange for an expenses-paid trip to Web Summit 2014 in Dublin:

1. [Effektif hosted BPM](effektif-hosted-bpm)
2. [Custom development with Effektif](effektif-custom-development)
3. [Systems integration with Effektif](effektif-web-services-integration)

This collaboration led to my next job, writing back-end code and content marketing for _Effektif_
(now [SAP Signavio Process Governance](https://www.signavio.com/products/process-governance/)).
And I never wrote a CV.
