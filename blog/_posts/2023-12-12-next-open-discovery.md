As AI technology continues to search for a problem to solve, many of its applications focus reducing the effort to complete onerous tasks.
Some applications write/create content for you, while others read/analyse existing content.
These tools’ product managers all have the same first question for their audience:
_what would you like to spend less time on?_

I recently tried a product discovery tool that asks a more ambitious question:
_what would you currently find impossible to achieve?_
Intriguingly, its answer promises to make my current biggest problem irrelevant.

## Too few customer conversations

In her book [Continuous Discovery Habits](https://www.producttalk.org/2021/05/continuous-discovery-habits/),
Teresa Torres explains the value of regularly talking to customers.
However, some contexts make this harder to achieve than others, such as for B2B products with relatively few customers.
In [One Knight in Product episode 71](https://www.oneknightinproduct.com/teresa-torres/), she expands on the reality for many product managers:

> I've never worked with a team that wasn't able to increase the frequency in which they engage with our customers.
> Not everybody gets to weekly… I will be up front about that.
> I encourage everybody to try to get to weekly, and the vast majority of teams can get to weekly.

Indeed, as a B2B SaaS product manager, I’ve experienced the challenge of weekly customer calls requiring a lot of work to arrange, sometimes even finding that many difficult to achieve.
If I had an AI magic wand, I wouldn’t use it to write product documents for me or automatically analyse customer sentiment.
I would wield it to get more customer calls.

## NEXT - product discovery platform

This year, I’ve explored various product discovery tools, such as [Orbit](orbit-review).
I recently spoke to [NEXT](https://www.nextapp.co) founder and CEO 
[Moodi Mahmoudi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moodimahmoudi/) about 
how NEXT helps product managers with discovery.

NEXT imports, and automatically transcribes and analyses customer call recordings, so product managers can use its AI chat interface to ask questions about what customers talk about.

I first thought that NEXT solves a problem I didn’t have: managing feedback from dozens of monthly customer calls, and synthesising more feedback than one person can assimilate.
Instead, when working with relatively few customers, I had plenty of time to conduct my own customer interviews, and analyse and write my own notes.
However, Moodi said one thing that suggested a way to redefine the problem.

## Direct access to every customer conversation

Moodi explained that with NEXT, you don’t have to upload every video manually, and posed the following question.

> What if you got the CEO to connect the company’s Zoom account to NEXT,
> so it automatically got every customer conversation?

Even with few customers, access to recordings of every regular meeting they have with the Customer Success team would already provide a lot more product feedback.
Of course, only remote-first companies that actually use Zoom for every customer call could do this.

To start with, this would reduce the dependency on Customer Success to summarise their meetings, in writing or in weekly meetings with the product team, while providing direct access to what customers actually say.
With NEXT, product managers could then generate short compilation videos to summarise evidence of common customer needs.

The story changes again, when the total daily duration of meetings with customers (and prospects) exceeds what a product manager could watch in a day, even if they did nothing else.
Here, the automatic transcription analysis becomes important, with its capability to summarise the day’s or week’s meetings.
Moodi added that this even works in multiple languages, citing a Swiss customer whose English-speaking product team can use the chat interface to research customer calls in French and German.

No doubt, this kind of broad access to customer calls would reduce manual work for the customer success team as much as for product managers, if not completely change their roles.
Of course this speculation all depends on a variation of Moodi’s rhetorical question:
_what would it take to persuade the CEO to actually share all customer calls with the product team?_
