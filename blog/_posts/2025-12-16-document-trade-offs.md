A 2018 YouGov survey reported that
[everyone around the world likes Italian cuisine](https://yougov.co.uk/consumer/articles/22632-italian-cuisine-worlds-most-popular).
Unfortunately, a 2021 follow-up reported that 
[everyone does Italian food wrong, according to Italians](https://yougov.com/articles/40810-italian-food-crimes).
This didn’t happen because of Italian recipes’ difficulty,
but because everyone makes different trade-offs and compromises, but not explicitly.

## Italian cooking

In Italy, the [Caprese salad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caprese_salad) consists of four ingredients,
arranged simply on a plate: mozzarella, tomato, basil, and olive oil.
This typifies the simplicity that characterises many classic Italian recipes.
Like cocktails, they combine few ingredients, often with minimal preparation.

Italian cooking looks like painting with primary colours:
if not the Italian flag’s, then like those of a 1980s shopping centre,
as opposed to a Scandinavian furniture shop’s shades of brown and grey.
The problem with Italian cooking outside Italy occurs earlier in the process.

## The shopping problem

Italian cooking relies heavily on the quality and availability of the fresh ingredients,
and barely uses the spices that appear in other Mediterranean cuisines.
This leaves those of us in colder Northern European climates with several options.

1. Fly to Italy, and buy fresh local ingredients at a food market.
2. Import preserved ingredients from Italy.
3. Use relatively bland Northern-European ingredients (that at least look okay in photos).
4. Adjust Italian recipes to build richer flavours.
5. Abandon any attempt to prepare recognisably-Italian food.

Either way, you get to choose a compromise, from among these options.
Some of them will annoy Italians, or your guests, though.
When you cook Italian food outside Italy, you have to make trade-offs.

## Trade-offs

Flying to Italy to buy cooking ingredients has a shocking cost,
while using ingredients from your local Northern Europe supermarket may lead to disappointing results.
Buying a mixture of fresh and preserved ingredients from a local Italian delicatessen,
if you have one, probably falls somewhere in between.

When you cook Italian food in Northern Europe,
you make a number of trade-offs when you shop for ingredients, including:

1. Time
2. Money
3. Environmental impact
4. Flavour
5. Authenticity
6. Novelty

You can’t please everyone, but when you do have to choose a compromise.
To set expectations, you can at least explicitly state which trade-offs you make.

## Software trade-offs and documentation compromises

Building software doesn’t have a lot to do with cooking, but both give you _more than one way to do it_.
Software design and product management enjoy an infinite hypermarket of options,
and just as many trade-offs and compromises.
