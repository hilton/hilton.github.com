Features don’t exist.
Records in databases, lines of code, commits and software releases are real.
So are business outcomes.
But although everyone talks about features from time to time,
we never really make them concrete.
Instead, we construct features on the fly,
for the length of a conversation.
They don’t really exist.

When we build software, we juggle roadmaps,
tests, deployments, analytics and support requests.
Software features tie all of these together,
but not explicitly.
Instead, we don’t have a clear idea about which features are released,
enabled, documented, popular, broken, unreliable or abandoned.
Because features don’t exist.

Attendees will broaden their perspective on software development,
and learn about how their work connects to other people’s.
They will discover a new way to have a positive impact in their team and on their career.
