1. Emoji vocabulary ←
2. Reaction emoji

When you use contemporary collaboration tools like Slack and Notion, you have a choice.
You can either complain about the [emoji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji)
and call them _unprofessional_, in which case you need [help](executive-training-remote#emoji),
or you can develop and use a consistent emoji vocabulary that makes document titles and section headings easier to browse.

If you don’t stop there, you also end up with an `#emoji-language` Slack channel,
for questions and answers about correct emoji usage, and their rules, exceptions and dialects.
And if it escalates, you go beyond the standardised Unicode emoji,
and start adopting slang, in the form of
[Slack custom emoji](https://slackmojis.com).

In the following vocabulary, each entry has an example of a title or heading that each emoji can introduce,
to [categorise it](activity-feed-design#emoji), 
group it with similar items, or add visual structure to a document outline.
You can develop your own similar vocabulary, focused on whatever you write about.

Note that you don’t _need_ to remember what each emoji means.
Instead, their value comes from making the content they proceed more recognisable.
But if you use them consistently, it won’t take long before you can _read_ them
