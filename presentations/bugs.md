You can blame programmers for bugs caused by typos in the code, and you can blame your product manager or product owner for features that your customer doesn't really need, but who's to blame for the universal bugs that all software has sooner or later? Universal bugs are the result of real-world complexity that no-one took account of. And time zones aren't the only nightmarish example: many kinds of names and numbers hide bugs that every developer can look forward to.

Data such as telephone numbers and people’s names have been around for longer than computers, and don’t need figuring out all over again. Starting from scratch leads to buggy code that doesn’t accommodate real-world complexity, and fails to benefit from international standards.

Every programmer needs to know what telephone numbers, house numbers and aircraft tail numbers have in common. You also need to know about validating email addresses and bank account numbers, and learn how unoriginal some of your bugs are. And more important than bugs that are easy to fix, we’ll see why coding with familiar data can lead to software that fails to be inclusive.
