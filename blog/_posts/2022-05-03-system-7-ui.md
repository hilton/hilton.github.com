Apple’s
[Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines](https://dl.acm.org/doi/book/10.5555/573097) 
(HIG, 1992) describes the Mac OS 
[System 7](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_7) user interface from 1991.
In the same year, Tim Berners-Lee first published his description of
[HTML Tags](http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/Tags.html),
the first public description of HTML.

Mac OS System 7 included standard user-interface controls.
Meanwhile, HTML 2.0 adding form controls in 1995, and since around 2011, web browsers gradually added support for HTML5’s richer set of form controls.
Browsers have now _nearly_ caught up with System 7.

## Button

Buttons offer perhaps the simplest interaction, for performing or cancelling actions.

{:.example}
![Alert box](system-7/alert-box-note.webp)

System 7 featured both a plain button (_Continue_) and an emphasised _default button_ (_Quit_).
HIG specifies that the button highlights when clicked.

<form>
<button>Continue</button> <button class=primary>Quit</button>
</form>

HTML 2.0 added form submit buttons, but without a standard way to indicate a default button, leaving this to CSS styling.
However, as soon as you style the button, changing the text and background colours as in the example above, the button’s style reverts to a bevelled CSS default that no longer matches the operating system style.
This includes a different highlight style when you click the button.

Today, default buttons typically have a solid highlight colour, often blue.
Unfortunately, the requirement to completely restyle the button to achieve this, leads to every web user interface and design system using its own button style that no longer resembles the user’s operating system’s style.
Perhaps this also explains the modern trend to restyle every web-based form control to match an application-specific design system, instead of using the default operating system style.

## Radio button

Radio buttons offer a single selection from several options,
[named after old car radios](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radio_button#Etymology),
which had mutually-exclusive pop-out buttons.

{:.example}
![System 7 views control panel](system-7/control-panel-views.webp)

System 7 radio buttons (_Straight grid_) only had a single representation, but could use horizontal or vertical layout, for ‘two to approximately seven items’.
HIG also notes that radio buttons should ‘never initiate an action’.

<form>
<input type=radio name=grid value=1> Straight grid
<br><input type=radio name=grid value=2> Staggered grid
</form>

HTML 2.0 added radio buttons, used the same way.

## Checkbox

Checkboxes offer multiple selection among several options, like boxes on a paper form that you check off with a check mark (_tick_ in British English).

{:.example}
![System 7 views control panel](system-7/control-panel-views.webp)

System 7 checkboxes (_Always snap to grid_) could have icons as well as text labels.
HIG notes that designers may find it difficult to choose a checkbox label that indicates two opposite states, in which case two radio buttons with separate might resolve the ambiguity.

<form>
<input type=checkbox value=1> Calculate folder sizes
<br><input type=checkbox value=2> Show disk info in header
</form>

HTML 2.0 added checkboxes that work the same way.
Some modern design systems avoid checkboxes in favour of a single style for both radio buttons and checkboxes, indicating single vs multiple selection differently.

## The score so far

Web-based user interfaces have had buttons since 1995.
However, HTML has never added Mac OS’ _default button_ semantics.
Meanwhile, radio buttons have become less fashionable, possibly as more modern button types have taken their place, or maybe because designers prefer a menu’s more predictable layout.

Despite making a good start with HTML 2.0, HTML has not caught up since, and still only scores 2½ out of three, compared to System 7 buttons.
Perhaps HTML does better, compared to System 7’s menus.
