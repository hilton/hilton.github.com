When you believe that words matter, you inevitably become uncomfortable with calling things what everyone else calls them.
You’ll want to modernise your product management jargon.

## Opportunity > problem

Product managers love to ask _what problem do you want to solve?_
This helps us focus on the _problem space_, and avoid getting sucked into premature solution design.
However, products can do more than solve customer **problems**.
Products can also delight customers, and give them new ways to succeed.
Products can have a strictly positive impact.

Therefore, talk about **opportunities**, and include those with a positive impact, not only _problems_.
Some people like to call them _bets_, but not everyone likes the gambling association.
Just don’t call your [product document](product-documents) a _product requirements document_ (PRD),
which sounds like something from 1980s corporate IT.

## Customer need > problem description

We sometimes write up discovery in a **problem description** that describes a customer pain or annoyance.
However, discovery doesn’t end when you’ve described a problem,
because you can’t always assume that customers _need_ a solution.

Therefore, go deeper and identify a **customer need**, the first step in mitigating demand risk.
Similarly, useful solutions _solve problems_, and so worthwhile problems _address actual needs_.

## Idea > feature request

Some product teams collect their customers’ **feature requests**,
which usually results in an [infinite backlog](infinite-backlog).
However, unless you work in IT consulting and outsource software design to clients, 
you don’t get paid for implementing feature requests:
they contain _feedback_, not commercial _orders_.
You also get stuck trying to resolve requests for overlapping or conflicting features.

Therefore, welcome customers’ **ideas**, and clarify your relationship with them.
This reframing makes it easier to recognise that you will receive _bad ideas_ as well as good ones.
Ideas overlap, and may reflect underlying needs in a [feature abstraction layer](backlog-abstraction-layer).
But take care with customers who may think that you don’t take their ‘requests’ seriously.

## Solution > feature

[Feature lifecycle management](feature-lifecycle) keeps track of software changes, 
and does a lot to make intangible work more concrete.
However, not all software changes add features, and not all work changes the software.

Therefore, design **solutions** to customer needs that include non-features such as _bug fixes and performance improvements_,
plus non-software improvements such as documentation updates.
The term _solution_ works better because it describes the work’s outcome, not its output.

## Task > issue/ticket

Several popular project management tools have **issues**,
which sometimes represent all kinds of tasks, and only sometimes represent actual reported problems.
This includes [newer tools](linear-projects) that did not start as bug/issue trackers, or help desk ticket managers.
They should know better, and didn’t need to inherit this obsolete naming.

Instead, call these [units of work](units-of-work) **tasks**, to better align with how teams use these tools.
Even better: consider using a tool that you can [configure to customise their names](cycle-review#configuration).

## (Anything) > insight

Product managers, and product marketing in particular, also seem to love the term **insight**.
However, intended meaning often remains fuzzy, or perhaps has a placeholder meaning:
_an insight represents whatever value you want it to have!_

At least the term _issue_ means something specific to the people who use it,
even if the word entirely loses its original English meaning.
Therefore, replace _insight_ with just about anything else, as long as it actually means something.
