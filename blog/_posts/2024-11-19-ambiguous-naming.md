Someone I know recently received an invitation to speak at an academic conference
with ‘Congress Helsinki 2025’ in its name.
The letter also contained practical information, including the location:

> The session will be held on 03/04/2025, from 09:00 to 10:00 in Copenhagen*.

They didn’t expect a Helsinki conference to have lectures in Copenhagen.
International collaborations sometimes complicate things,
but a mistake in the invitation letter would also explain a location in another country.

They double-checked the location, before deciding whether to book a flight to Finland or Denmark.
It turns out that the conference venue has named the _meeting room_ ‘Copenhagen’.

## Naming difficulty

Despite the [well-known difficulty of naming things](why-naming-things-is-hard),
naming a meeting room after a location fails unnecessarily badly.
The ambiguity will inevitably create confusion.

I have also experienced meeting room confusion,
while working for a company that named their Berlin office meeting rooms after Berlin districts.
This didn’t usually cause problems,
although a ‘team meeting in Tiergarten’ could plausibly refer going to
[Café am Neuen See](https://www.cafeamneuensee.de/biergarten) after work.

However, asking after a colleague who happens to live in Prenzlauerberg makes ‘in Prenzlauerberg’ ambiguous.
You don’t know whether to look for them in the meeting room, or contact them at home.
Next, you’ll tell someone that, ‘they didn’t come to the office today’.

## Bad naming

As with all naming problems, start by not naming things badly - _ambiguously_ in this case.

* **Place names** give you a nice set of names to choose from, but  _Copenhagen_ and  _Tiergarten_ create ambiguity that doesn’t encumber, say, [asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_exceptional_asteroids) or [fictional prisons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_fictional_prisons).
* **Cute themes** for meeting rooms, such as _The monkey cage_ (not made up!), become awkward or embarrassing before long.

Instead, you should at least manage to do better than:

* **concise and unique (but boring) names** - when you call the third meeting room on the second floor _MR 2.3_
* **hotel rooms**, like  _Room 203_ - only slightly less boring
* **famous people’s names** - not ambiguous, but can result in things you want to ever have to say out loud when someone asks where to find you (‘you’ll find me in…’).

Alternatively, when facing a multiple-naming problem like this,
you can reuse a name collection you already have.

## Context ambiguity

[Tableair writes](https://tableair.com/blog-75-creative-meeting-room-names-ideas-and-mistakes-to-avoid/)
that creating meeting room names ‘offers a unique opportunity to reflect a company’s culture, values, and creativity’.
For example, in 2018 I ran an XP Days Benelux workshop at a [Dutch hotel](https://www.kapellerput.nl/en/floor-plan/)
whose _MeetingDesign Team_ has chosen meeting room names that align with their _MeetingSuccess_ goal.
Translated, they include:

* The Cooperation
* The Experience
* The Creativity
* The Inspiration
* The Interaction
* The Challenge

The definite articles make these names stand out in sentences like,
‘I’ll see you after lunch in _The Inspiration_’ (you can hear the emphasis).
No doubt they also perform well in their target market.

Despite this sophistry, these don’t _sound like_ meeting room names, however.
Plucking names from a different context, such as meeting goals, leads to this different kind of ambiguity.
In domain-driven design terms, these names unwisely reuse domain language from bounded context in another.

## Good naming

In practice, good names require more than to avoid ambiguity.
Worse, you cannot easily _rename_ meeting rooms, so you probably only have one chance to get it right.
Either way, some naming problems deserve some thought about what good looks like.
