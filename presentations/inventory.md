Any simple day-to-day problem can be a complicated software project,
if you overthink it enough.
This case study tells the story of how I turned the problem of planning supermarket deliveries
into an even bigger inventory management problem.
I ended up obsessively over-complicating everything, 
and expanded the scope to include spend control, price optimisation, storage locations,
and stock levels.
The story leads to how I chose a software solution,
and an unexpected lesson about commercial software development.

Attendees will learn about the biggest software design tradeoff,
and that you don’t have to craft or build physical things to have a nerdy home project.
In fact, any complex software problem can be a hobby project, if you simplify it enough.
You’ll also learn that managing physical inventory can be exceedingly satisfying,
and can even save you money.
