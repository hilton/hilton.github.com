Meetings are a problem for any organisations, because they dull the attention-span of otherwise intelligent people, and prevent otherwise productive people from getting any work done. Software developers suffer more than most, because they can’t even _pretend_ that they’re getting any work done when they’re sitting in meetings. After all, getting your laptop out and writing code during a meeting is (rightly) considered rude.

This presentation introduces various approaches that software developers can use to reduce the number of meetings in their organisation, so they have more time to write code. In particular, developer contributions to project management can drastically reduce the number of meetings.
