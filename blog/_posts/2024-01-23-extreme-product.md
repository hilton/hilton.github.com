[Extreme programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org) won.
What seemed extreme in 1999 went mainstream:
user stories, solution spikes, pair programming, unit tests, and 
frequent incremental releases.
Recently, as software development has shifted from projects to products,
new extreme practices have emerged.

We call these practices _extreme_, not because nobody applies them,
but because not enough people believe ‘impossible’ things.

{:#remote-first}
## Remote-first

_Remote-first_, means extreme fully-remote work:
all staff, all business processes, all the time.
It creates organisation-building flexibility,
but requires reinventing internal practices.
For this, teams must communicate effectively with colleagues outside the room,
company-wide.

{:#part-time}
## Part-time employment

Variable working hours create team-composition and work-assignment flexibility.
Attitudes and legislation vary by country:
some find part-time work as extreme as remote work,
while others base roles on the most work that a single person can do in a week.
For this, teams must collaborate effectively and share roles,
without escalating coordination costs.

{:#async-work}
## Asynchronous work

Replacing daily stand-up meetings with asynchronous updates unlocks daily planning flexibility,
but requires more literacy.
Employees read and write more,
using more modern tools,
and have fewer synchronous meetings.
For this, the team must also know what will work on, for the coming week,
instead of daily task drip-feeding.

{:#short-backlog}
## Short backlog

A short product backlog, typically with only enough development work for a week or two,
frees the team from wasteful discussions and pointless backlog management.
Reducing unnecessary meetings requires reducing the causes of unnecessary meetings,
starting with product backlogs containing months’ worth of work that the team will never start.
For this, the team needs a high-level understanding of what theyw will work on,
for the coming months, and a way to quickly resolve questions about the work.

{:#okrs}
## Quarterly OKRs

High-level objectives, together with key results that make progress visible,
can replace the need to spend significant effort continuously estimating development effort.
Focusing on what matters enables the actual delivery that reduces demand for predictions.
For this, the team also needs quick answers to questions,
while making progress without drowning in troubleshooting.

{:#available-product-manager}
## Available product manager

An [available product manager](two-minute-rule),
who responds immediately to questions about the work,
can work with high-level objectives and a short-term backlog.
Freedom from _requirements_ and _specifications_ makes time available for higher impact work.
For this, the product manager needs to build trust with the team,
and an environment that won’t punish them if they do become blocked.

{:#zero-bug}
## Zero bug target

Like a short product backlog, a [zero-bug target](zero-bug-policy) reduces waste.
More importantly, it reduces quality surprises that make delivery less predictable.
For this, the team must fix any bug quickly, without getting stuck.

{:#team-programming}
## Team programming

[Team programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Team_programming)
resolves development tasks quickly, without a single stuck developer blocking progress,
but requires total teamwork.
Like [part-time work](#part-time), this needs the team to avoid relying on a single person.
This requires enough trust, for example, to share recognition for the work.

{:#trust-relationships}
## Trustful relationships

We often talk about people _working well together_ without making it clear what that means,
despite its obvious basis for productivity and all things good.
Effective organisations understand
[trust relationships](https://scand.com/company/blog/how-to-build-a-successful-distributed-software-development-team/),
and actively coach teams to build them.
For this, the team needs an environment where they can build these relationships.

{:#psychological-safety}
## Psychological safety

The understanding that teams require
[psychological safety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety)
may represent the biggest advancement in software development since Extreme Programming,
and other agile methods.

This needs the most extreme thing of all: 
enough humility in the executive team to value product development built on trust and safety, 
instead of offices, meetings, backlogs and
[management-by-fear](https://www.entrepreneur.com/leadership/unveiling-the-link-between-fear-based-management-and/452744).
