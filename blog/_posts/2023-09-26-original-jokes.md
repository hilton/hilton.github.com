4. Joke cycles

Jokes, even more than books and song lyrics, seem to become public domain as soon as they make someone laugh,
unfortunately for comedy writers, who rarely get credit for the jokes they write that become _memes_
(in [Dawkins’ sense](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme) rather than
[image macros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_macro) a.k.a.
[lolcats](https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2008-05-27-how-draw-lolcats)).

Ever since programmers started using social media, programming jokes have had something new: timestamps and search.
The following jokes reappear regularly without credit, but these first sightings on Twitter likely reveal their original authors.

## 2009

[Nicholas Smith’s 2009-05-21 tweet](https://twitter.com/nicholassmith/status/1872576626)
appeared way back when Twitter first started to experience rapid growth:

{:.big.solid-one style="max-width:17.5em"}
> There are no bugs, just surprise features

For example, 
[Marit van Dijk](https://twitter.com/MaritvanDijk77) found
[a 2022 tweet](https://twitter.com/ExceptionNotFnd/status/1545047089524002819)
that copies the original joke without credit.

## 2010

[Leon Bambrick’s 2010-01-01 tweet](https://twitter.com/secretGeek/status/7269997868)
remains the first and most popular variation on
[Phil Karlton’s original joke](why-naming-things-is-hard):

{:.big.solid-two style="max-width:33em"}
> The two hardest programming problems are cache invalidation, naming things and off by one errors

## 2011

[Nick Murphy’s 2011-04-27 tweet](https://twitter.com/NickEVM/status/63205139959390209)
hasn’t spread as much, but scores points for the pun:

{:.big.solid-four style="max-width:29em"}
> Just started a band called 1023MB.  
> We haven't done a gig yet.

[Paul Malin’s 2011-11-12 tweet](https://twitter.com/P_Malin/status/135467325796265984)
contains code, which makes it hard to
[tell out loud](https://www.felienne.com/archives/5947):

{:.big.solid-three style="max-width:27em"}
> What's yellow and dangerous?  
> `*((int*)rand()) = 0xffff00;`

This riffs on the children’s
[shark-infested custard joke](https://twitter.com/gavinandstacytv/status/1300906218517680135).
The C code overwrites a random memory location with a 
[number that represents yellow](https://www.colorhexa.com/ffff00), 
and may cause the computer to crash spectacularly, although not necessarily in yellow.

## 2012

[Anthony Steele’s 2012-03-26 tweet](https://twitter.com/AnthonySteele/status/184250877392072705) (private account) brilliantly upgrades a classic groaner:

{:.big.solid-five style="max-width:34em"}
> There are 10 kinds of programmers: those who understand binary, those who don't, and those who didn't expect a base 3 joke.

[Raoul du Plessis’ 2012-10-25 tweet](https://twitter.com/raouldp/status/261514559192440832)
ventures successfully into observational humour:

{:.big.solid-one style="max-width:39em"}
> I only play computer games to have an IT task I can complete without requirements changing.

## 2014

[Phillip Bowden’s 2014-05-20 tweet](https://twitter.com/pbowden/status/468855097879830528)
inevitably became my favourite programming joke, because it references both
[naming](/tag/naming) and programming jokes:

{:.big.solid-two style="max-width:41em"}
> There are two hard problems in computer science: we only have one joke and it’s not funny

[Bill Sempf’s 2014-09-23 tweet](https://twitter.com/sempf/status/514473420277694465) (account now deleted, but the 
[tweet ID reveals the date](https://oduwsdl.github.io/tweetedat/#514473420277694465))
has spread even more than the Phil Karlton joke, in an untestable number of variations:

{:.big.solid-three style="max-width:38em"}
> QA Engineer walks into a bar. Orders a beer. Orders 0 beers. Orders 999999999 beers. 
> Orders a lizard. Orders -1 beers. Orders a sfdeljknesv.

[Sempf’s blog post](https://www.sempf.net/post/On-Testing1)
included the joke with its backstory, and some variations.

## 2015

[Matthias Verraes’ 2015-08-14 tweet](https://twitter.com/mathiasverraes/status/632260618599403520)
takes the Karlton joke to network programming:

{:.big.solid-four style="max-width:28em"}
> There are only two hard problems in distributed systems:  
> 2\. Exactly-once delivery  
> 1\. Guaranteed order of messages  
> 2\. Exactly-once delivery

## 2016

[I Am Devloper’s 2016-02-03](https://twitter.com/iamdevloper/status/694848050796212224)
laments the coder condition:

{:.big.solid-five style="max-width:29em"}
> The software development process:
> 
> i can’t fix this
> 
> *crisis of confidence*  
> *questions career*  
> *questions life*
> 
> oh it was a typo, cool

## 2017

[Romeu Moura’s 2017-11-10 tweet](https://twitter.com/malk_zameth/status/928974920276697088) established 
[domain-driven design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design),
with its first proper joke:

{:.big.solid-one style="max-width:40em"}
> In the culinary bounded context: 🍅 is a vegetable  
> In the botanic bounded context: 🍅 is a fruit  
> In 🎭 bounded context: 🍅 is feedback

In hindsight, if you publish a book that single-handedly establishes a new field or discipline,
as Eric Evans did with his [2003 book](http://dddcommunity.org/book/evans_2003/),
the second edition’s chapter title pages would ideally introduce the field’s standard jokes.
As [the importance of programming jokes](domain-jokes) explains,
a book and a Wikipedia page alone do not establish a culture.
