I found a new path to the [joy of coding](https://joyofcoding.org)
when I changed role from developer to product manager,
and then stopped asking developers for estimates.
Here’s a chapter from my story.

This talk isn’t about extreme sports.
That’s when you’re sporty in mid-air.

It’s also not about [extreme ironing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_ironing).

I’ve taken inspiration from 
[Extreme Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_programming), 
which was extreme 25 years ago.
People got really upset about pair programming, among other practices.
But not any more: Extreme Programming won.

If you don’t do any extreme practices that’s up to you.
After all, they’re not easy.
But you can’t tell me they’re not possible,
because I experienced real examples.

Working **remote** remains controversial, but I’ve worked for two remote-first companies.
The most surprising thing I learned is how well it filters out arseholes.
Remote-first companies typically were from the beginning,
so we’re talking about start-ups.

Working **part-time** is common in this country, but sadly, it’s still gendered.
Fundamentally, it’s a happiness issue: life’s about more than your job.
I’ve worked part-time for the last ten years, and even taken sabbaticals.
I’m privileged, of course: I could afford to use a pay rise to work fewer hours.

Working **asynchronously** comes naturally to programmers, but not to normal people, unfortunately.
Remote-first and part-time work depend on it - those are dependency arrows.
It’s more inclusive.
It means more thinking, fewer meetings, and less of a performance - less showing off.
You have to value written communication over showing off in meetings.
… and learn to communicate honestly in chat.

A **short backlog** is the opposite of waterfall project management.
It radically simplifies planning and tooling.
Short means fewer than ten tasks you haven’t started, and limited work-in-progress,
so you can leave space for new opportunities.

**Objectives and key results** organise those opportunities.
OKRs made it possible for me to work with a short backlog, and no estimates.
You plan problems to solve instead of features to build,
and reduce stakeholder demand for feature release dates.

I decided to be an **available product manager**.
Availability enables continuous collaboration, and you get higher quality software, and less rework.
For example, developers’ questions can interrupt my meetings, and I respond to everything on Slack.

A manager once shouted at me for suggesting a **zero-bug policy**, so it’s definitely extreme.
Open bugs waste time, and invalidate what you should be learning during development.
So, instead of tracking bugs, you fix them.
However, fixing tricky bugs requires proper team work.

**Team programming** dials pair programming up to 11.
And just because you have fewer meetings doesn’t mean you don’t want to work together.
So sometimes, you work in a group without having a meeting.
You only need two people in a video call to start; you let FOMO do the rest.

So here we have extreme development practices that depend on each other. What else?

I realised that all of these practices also depend on **psychological safety**.
They depend on people believing that they will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up.
Without psychological safety, these practices don’t work.
Without psychological safety, you’re left with dysfunctional teams and toxic working environments.

In fact, **all product development** depends on psychological safety.
You’d be surprised how rare this is. Or not, if you’ve worked in tech for a while.

But like Juke said,
‘People are amazing in their creativity 
when they realise they have the power to change things.’
