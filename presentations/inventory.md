Any simple day-to-day problem can be a complicated software project, if you overthink it enough.
This mini-case study shows my inventory management system for managing supermarket deliveries. 
It includes inventory management techniques, turning it into a software problem,
my solution, and an unexpected lesson about commercial software development.

Attendees will learn about the biggest software design tradeoff,
and that you don’t have to craft or build physical things to have a nerdy home project.
In fact, any complex software problem can be a hobby project, if you simplify it enough. 
You’ll also learn that managing physical inventory can be exceedingly satisfying,
and even save money.
