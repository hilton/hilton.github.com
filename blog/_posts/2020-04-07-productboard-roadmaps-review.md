[productboard](https://www.productboard.com/) - product management SaaS - lets you manage:

* [product backlogs](productboard-product-backlog-review)
* [customer feedback](productboard-customer-feedback-review)
* roadmaps _(this review)_
* customer portals.

In productboard, the [Roadmap board](https://help.productboard.com/en/articles/260208-6-roadmap-communicate-your-plan) presents selected product backlog items in columns.
As with the product backlog, you can choose between different kinds of view, and switch between saved views.

## What I like - roadmap organisation and multiple views

I like how you create multiple sets of _releases_, so you can have Q1, Q2, Q3 on one roadmap, and Now, Next, Later on another, say.
You put a _feature_ on the roadmap by assigning it to one or more releases, which means that one feature can appear on multiple roadmaps, spanning more than one release.
A sub-feature belongs to a single release, which nicely matches how I use features for long-term ‘initiatives’ and sub-features for short-term ‘epics’.
(I don’t use productboard to track the user stories in each epic.)

I also like the ability to display a roadmap as swim lanes for objectives or product components.
The screenshot shows columns for two monthly release, and two objectives swim lanes (the blue bars).
The features’ and sub-features’ coloured dots indicate feature statuses, such as _In progress_.

Adding swim lanes and hiding sub-features gives me a high-level that I can present more easily, to start with, before showing the more detailed feature-based roadmap.
In general, the saved views help 

## What I don’t like - limited publishing options

Working with quarterly market releases means presenting the roadmap each quarter.
productboard roadmaps have an Export to image feature, which looks useful for including the roadmap as a presentation slide.
However, no-one can read the design’s tiny low-contrast text in a presentation.
That doesn’t matter for screen-sharing in online meetings, though, with everyone working from home at the time of writing.

Exporting a roadmap screenshot to a presentation slide feels clunky.
I miss better options for sharing and publishing presentation-ready roadmaps.

I also miss ways for stakeholders to keep track of roadmap changes, or view a history of changes.
With a relatively stable roadmap, customer service people need to know about changes, as well as plans.

## Conclusion

The roadmaps board doesn’t suffer from the features board’s complexity, and doesn’t need the insight’s board’s complex linking.
As a result, I find it much easier to use and share roadmaps than product backlogs, and have less to explain than for customer feedback.
Unfortunately, productboard roadmaps lack collaboration features: unlike features and notes, people can’t add comments on roadmaps, for example.
I rate productboard roadmaps as solid, but nothing special.
