People often abuse the term [living document](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Living_document)
when sharing a document with other people who could potentially keep it up-to-date but who, in practice, will do no such thing.
Calling something a _living document_ doesn’t mean that someone else will ever update it.

The term _living document_ comes from a simpler time when a document always described the past, and a document’s _lifecycle_ meant archiving it and writing another one.
But now, living documents’ time has run out.

## On paper

Before computers, the term _document_ referred to the original artefact of written material on paper, or [vellum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vellum) or other 
[parchment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parchment), if you go back far enough.
A _document_ had a different status to _copies_.
In this context, a document resembles a published book:
no-one modifies a document after publishing it, as the usual way of doing things.

The idea of a _living document_ comes from the once novel idea of continuing to update a document throughout its lifetime of use.
On a paper document, these updates would involve a mess of annotations or corrections, while a word-processor document remains _editable_.

## On the web

From the beginning, the natural way of web pages allows them to change from one day to the next.
This has become the dominant _document_ paradigm, and the original kind of document the exception - such as the photograph of a manuscript (in its original meaning of _hand-written_).
While the original vision for an editable web had a slow start, wikis and blogging tools eventually established the idea of editable web pages.

The editable web took mindshare from word-processors, whose limited ability to publish their documents now makes them feel old-fashioned.
I wrote about having abandoned word-processors professionally back in 2006, in
[Wiki is my word-processor](https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2006-12-04-wiki-my-word-processor).
Today, word-processor documents inhabit an unusual place, and _living document_ has become a decreasingly useful concept.

## In meetings

These days, if anyone calls something a _living document_ in a meeting, you need to have a conversation about a document lifecycle process.
Now that we have such a broad digital spectrum between text that someone literally wrote in stone and what someone just wrote on a whiteboard (when they use the right pen!), it helps to make expectations explicit.
For example, you can answer questions like the following in all sorts of combinations.

* Will the document have multiple versions?
* What will trigger a document update?
* Does the original author have responsibility for updating the document after publication?
* Which corrections and other changes require a new publication date?
* Will the document list its version history, authors, or changes?
* Does the document have a publication status that corresponds to a maintenance process step?
* Who participates in the document maintenance process, in which roles?

Only when you answer _no/nothing/nobody_ to every one of these questions do you have something other than a living document.
But following the death of the living document, document lifecycles remain.
