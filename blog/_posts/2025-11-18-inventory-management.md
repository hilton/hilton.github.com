Back in 2020, I started playing an _inventory management_ game at home.
I signed up for a supermarket home delivery service,
to avoid the supermarket during lockdown.
This introduced an interesting complication.

## Home inventory

I wanted to order every week, to have fresh fruit and vegetables,
but the minimum order value meant ordering more food than I needed.
I would have to order additional non-perishable goods that I would eventually use.

The obvious solution involves topping up orders with Champagne,
to reach the minimum order value, but I didn’t want to make a habit of that.
Meanwhile, some orders cost well over the minimum,
such as when I needed more dishwasher tablets, or other infrequent purchases.

## Spend control

To avoid ‘having’ to order bubbly every other week,
I started spreading out infrequent purchases, especially expensive ones.
That way I could avoid over-spending by ‘topping up’ orders to the minimum value,
and _stocking up_ on some products in advance.

This resulted in an inventory of over 100 stock items,
and tracking each item’s **product name** and **inventory** (quantity).
Most food items appear in the storeroom photo (above), excluding fridge and freezer contents.

## Storeroom location

Before placing each order, I’d check for out-of-stock products.
Going through the list of products I ordered required a consistent location for each one,
so I had to shelve stock consistently.
I recorded each stock item’s **shelf** location,
using spreadsheet-style column-row references:

These locations remained stable,
except for occasional relocations to accommodate _maximum inventory_ changes.

## Price optimisation

Supermarket [sales promotions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_promotion)
offer discounts to browse, for the week containing the delivery date.
By stocking up on discounted goods, to reach the minimum order value,
I could reduce costs enough to more than cover the delivery subscription fee.
This made the game even more _satisfying_, but caused a new problem:

![Spaghetti overstock – 12 packs of spaghetti and spaghettini](inventory/spaghetti.webp)

After a series of [BOGOF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_one,_get_one_free) 
(buy one, get one free) offers, I had ordered lots of spaghetti and _spaghettini_
(blue/yellow packets in the centre of the photo, above).

## Overstock

Spaghetti lasts a long time, but not necessarily _forever_.
I discovered several products that we use more slowly than I had realised,
and that I had overachieved during discount-driven stocking-up.

Flour tortillas last about six months, and we use about one pack per month,
so whatever the discount, I shouldn’t have inventory of more than six packs.
Based on usage and shelf life,
I estimated the maximum inventory I could safely stock for each product,
to avoid [overstocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overstock).

I occasionally had to adjust the _maximum stock_.
To make it easier for slow-moving products, I added the product’s **shelf life** –
the number of months from delivery until its _best before_ date.

## Last discount

Sometimes, nothing on my list had a discount to stock up with,
so I might have had to stock up to the maximum inventory without using a discount.
This would remove the option to use a future discount for that product.

I started tracking which products never have a discount, by noting the **last discount** year.
Then I could see which products probably won’t have a discount next week.

## Inventory management

Unsurprisingly, I couldn’t do this domestic inventory management in my head,
and the supermarket web site didn’t help with my home inventory.
I needed another software tool, which leads to the next part of the game.
