You should [upgrade your online meeting audio](meeting-audio),
because bad audio makes online meetings unnecessarily tiring.
You don’t have to stop there:
if you have a bigger budget, you could sound _excellent_ in meetings.

## The other love language

A few years ago, I worked on a fully-remote team that had two
[love languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Love_Languages):
a rich vocabulary of
[reaction emoji](reaction-emoji) and _excellent audio_.
We got the latter from two things the company had:

1. values of empathy and inclusion – so we cared about our colleagues’ meeting experience
2. a home office equipment budget – so we could upgrade our audio even more.

When I joined the company, I had already upgraded to a cheap headset,
which made me easy to hear in calls.
But it still had a cheap microphone, and didn’t sound _excellent_.
I wanted to upgrade again, to sound as good as my teammates.

## Office equipment

We compared home office set-ups in our `#office-equipment` Slack channel.
An audiophile colleague posted a microphone product guide,
for everyone who wanted something better than a cheap headset:

1. mid-range – condenser microphone
2. high-end – podcast dynamic microphone
3. ridiculous – studio dynamic microphone.

I opted for the relatively high-end option of a 
[Røde Podmic](https://rode.com/en/microphones/broadcast/podmic) podcast microphone,
[Røde PSA1+](https://rode.com/en/accessories/stands-bars/psa1-plus) microphone boom arm, and an 
[Arturia Minifuse 2](https://www.arturia.com/products/audio/minifuse/minifuse2) audio interface.
I probably could have got the same audio quality from a desktop podcast microphone
with a USB interface, 
instead of using an expensive microphone stand and a separate audio interface, but I had my reasons.

## Podcast microphones

The explosion of hipster podcasts created a market for amateur audio quality what the 1980s’
[desktop publishing revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_publishing#History)
did for amateur print layout and typography.
_Podcast microphone_ gives you a convenient category for a high-quality microphone designed for
home use, with a computer, and targeting speech, rather than singing or musical instruments.

## Dynamic microphones

If you can afford it, you’ll sound better with a
[dynamic microphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone#Dynamic)
instead of a 
[condenser microphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microphone#Condenser).
Condenser microphones sound different because they pick up sound from further away,
including background noise and room acoustics.
You have to position  a dynamic microphone much closer to your mouth, to allow for this.

A dynamic microphone deliveres the familiar more direct radio DJ sound of someone much closer to you,
without background noise or reverberation from the room.
It also means you can recreate that silky smooth late-night radio DJ sound,
by lowering your voice, and moving really close to the microphone.

## Online executive presence

You don’t _need_ to sound like a radio DJ, although it does add a certain something to presentations.
But sounding physically closer to your audience sounds more engaging than a room that echoes,
or the slightly muffled result of meeting software background noise removal.
Excellent audio give remote workers the first step towards online _executive presence_.
