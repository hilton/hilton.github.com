[The well-known difficulty of naming things](why-naming-things-is-hard)
explains why so many things have bad names.
The worst examples often come in sets, because someone wanted related names for a collection of related things.

## Places

[Place names inevitably cause confusion](ambiguous-naming) unless you use sufficiently abstract names.
If you can‚Äôt come up with good names, try indulging in **unhinged naming**.

Unhinged place names:

1. **districts of the city** ‚Äì including areas you might reasonably go to for a work event
2. **cities** ‚Äì where you might plausibly have other offices
3. **countries** ‚Äî especially if people travel internationally to visit clients.

You can safely use the names of astronomical bodies ‚Äì¬†planets, moons and asteroids,
unless you work in the space industry.

## Cardinal directions

[Compass directions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_of_the_compass) don‚Äôt often occur as venue names,
but have the advantage of additional levels of precisions and standard abbreviations,
e.g. _Northeast Room_ (NE).

Unhinged compass direction names:

1. **directions from reception** ‚Äì as a sequence of compass directions, e.g _N-W-NE-S_
2. **the exact direction from reception** ‚Äì¬†using [32 points of the compass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Points_of_the_compass#32-wind_compass_rose), e.g. _northeast by north_ (NEbN), after rebuilding the office to make these names/directions unique
3. **directions from a bigger meeting room** ‚Äì to name small meeting rooms based on their direction from larger rooms, e.g. you get to _Northeast by North_ by going north from room _Northeast_.

Example: [South By Southwest](https://www.sxsw.com) a.k.a. SXSW (conference rather than meeting room).


## People

Using people‚Äôs names introduces a deliberate category error to make them unambiguous meeting room names.
You can use fictional characters‚Äô locations to make them more memorable,
e.g. _Santa‚Äôs Grotto_ or _King Arthur‚Äôs Castle_.

Unhinged people‚Äôs names:

1. **common employee given names** ‚Äì e.g. _Nicolas_ and _Anna_
2. **famous people** ‚Äì e.g. _Einstein‚Äôs office_
3. **employee of the month** ‚Äì rename a meeting room after the latest winner, every month.

If you don‚Äôt mind a pretentious option, name meeting rooms after famous painters,
and hang a print of their most famous work on the wall.

## Colours

Colour names continue the progression to more abstract meeting room names.

Unhinged colour names:

1. **obscure [CSS colour names](https://www.w3.org/wiki/CSS/Properties/color/keywords)** ‚Äì e.g. _Burly wood_ (light brown) and _Gainsboro_ (light grey)
2. **hexadecimal RGB values** ‚Äì e.g. call the teal room _#088_, and Gainsboro _#dcdcdc_
3. **garish colours** ‚Äì e.g. _Hot Pink_, and paint the walls, ceiling and floor to match

To play it safe, decorate rooms according to their names, e.g. yellow objects in the Yellow Room.


## Symbols

Symbols could work, provided that everyone knows how to pronounce them.

Unhinged (unpronounceable) symbol names:

1. **[runes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rune)**
2. **[kanji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanji)**
3. **[hazard class pictograms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADR_(treaty)#ADR_pictograms)** ‚Äì other [hazard symbols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hazard_symbol)

You could safely use certain emoji,
in the same way that car parks often name their sections like üöÅ _Helicopter_,
so your children can tell you where you parked.
Chemical elements, and their standard two-letter abbreviations, might also work.


## Numbers

[You can use numbers as unique names](non-numeric-numbers), called _nominative numbers_,
as long as you choose memorable ones.

Unhinged numerical names:

1. **UUID** ‚Äì e.g. _D266FF16-2C2F-4237-99A6-4445C1B6708D_
2. **exact meeting room latitude-longitude** ‚Äì e.g. _51.17887234, -1.82618255_
3. **meeting room volume** (in millilitres)

The most boring meeting room names combine a floor number and room number,
either separated like _2.10_, or in hotel-style room numbers like _210_.
You‚Äôll see this kind of naming if you work in the space industry,
so you don‚Äôt have to worry about meeting rooms named after cute asteroid names, in practice.
