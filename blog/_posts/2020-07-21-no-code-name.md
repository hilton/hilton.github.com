Everyone finds naming difficult, so when a name emerges from a community or industry, rather than a specific decision, problems with the name shouldn’t surprise us.
I don’t particularly like _no-code automation_ automation, for example, and hope that a better name will replace it.
Fortunately, we can sometimes fix naming by _renaming_ things, or we can at least dream.

When you named something yourself, you can sometimes _rename_ it when you think of a better name.
That doesn’t work for community names that don’t have an official owner, but you can always hope that a better name will catch on, if enough people hear it.

## Agile → cloud

No-code shares a problem with agile - as an adjective, it describes something compared to the previous status quo:
text-based programming and waterfall software development, respectively.
While that helps with differentiation, it doesn’t make a good name for a _thing_.

Cloud computing came from an earlier low-key IT revolution, whose single change from self-hosting to cloud-hosting had long-term consequences.
Maybe the naming helped: while _cloud-hosting_ compares to the previous kind of hosting, eventually, everyone ended up talking about _the cloud_ (definitely _a thing_).

## #NoEstimates → forecasts

_No-code_ has the same problem as _#NoEstimates_ - naming based on the space it _doesn’t_ occupy.
However, as [Willem-Jan Ageling](https://twitter.com/WJAgeling) points out
[#NoEstimates: the name doesn’t make sense, but why is this an issue?] -
noting that #NoEstimates discussion promotes forecasting instead of estimation.
Something about _forecasting_ would make a better name.

Similarly, while non-parents may think of themselves as _child-free_ rather than _childless_,
_codeless automation_ offers a slight improvement, but remains negative.

No-code automation modernises programming by 
[replacing text-based code with GUI discoverability](automation-without-secret-codes).
Perhaps a better name replaces _no-code_ with something like:

* GUI
* graphical
* visual
* discoverable

## Ciphertext → cleartext

[Comparing source code to secret codes](automation-without-secret-codes) might also lead us to cryptography jargon.
Cryptography makes the distinction between [ciphertext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ciphertext),
[plaintext](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plaintext) and
[cleartext](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleartext).

_Plain automation_ doesn’t sound great, though.
Worse: it sounds like _plain old automation_, which would mean exactly the wrong thing (a 
[retronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retronym)).
_Clear automation_ sounds nice but, ironically, fails to make the cryptography reference clear.

## Financial planning → spreadsheet

They say that corporate IT installs both kinds of software: word-processors _and_ spreadsheets.
Somehow, both software categories’ names avoid the above problems.
Instead of naming the problem they solve, or even how they do it, they name the basic low-level thing the software does.

Thinking about what no-code automation tools do, on a lower level, leads to names like:

* **flow builders** (a good enough name for [a commercial product](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=flow_builder.htm&type=5))
* **task sequencer** (which reminds me of the [music sequencers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_sequencer) I played with as a teenager)
* **protocol plans**
* **block boards** (also acceptably alliterative)

Realistically, though, I don’t actually expect a better name to catch on any time soon.
And even though it only took writing a few [#NoCode blog posts](/tag/nocode) for the name to annoy me, I can probably cope with no-code automation.
