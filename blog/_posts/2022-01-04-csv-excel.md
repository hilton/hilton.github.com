## Character encoding misidentification

A CSV file by itself doesn’t specify its own character encoding, so Excel guesses.
As illustrated in an earlier article on [CSV character encoding](csc-encoding),
this results in saving data about Mötley Crüe, and later opening it to discover the rather less metal `M√∂tley Cr√ºe`.

This fails because Excel parses the CSV using its system-specific default character encoding, not Unicode UTF-8.
Excel has guessed badly for years, already:
[Wikipedia reports](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8#Adoption) that
UTF-8 became the most popular text encoding on the web in 2008.

Note that importing a CSV file instead of opening it at least gives you the option of selecting the correct _File origin_ :

![Excel file import wizard](excel-import.png){: srcset="excel-import-2x.png 2x"}

Excel takes a local view by assuming that it saved any CSV file on the same system, and opens it using its own default encoding.
In addition to Microsoft’s slowness in noticing that everyone else uses UTF-8, they still haven’t shifted mindset to understand that most files live on some else’s computer, accessed via the web.
[CSV on the web](csvw) defines a more modern standard.

## Unicode misidentification

On a more technical note, Excel does try to automatically identify Unicode CSV, but gets it wrong.
It turns out that Excel saves UTF-8 CSV _with_ a 
[byte order mark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark) (BOM), 
and when opening CSV only recognises the encoding as UTF-8 if a BOM is present.

[Wikipedia explains further](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark#UTF-8):

> Microsoft compilers and interpreters, and many pieces of software on Microsoft Windows such as Notepad treat the BOM as a required magic number rather than use heuristics.
> These tools add a BOM when saving text as UTF-8, and cannot interpret UTF-8 unless the BOM is present or the file contains only ASCII

## Illicit typing

When you enter values by hand, Excel’s implicit typing infers data types for numbers and dates.
If this annoys because you have to correct the corrupted values, consider the implication of Excel doing the same thing when it opens CSV:

| Name | Code | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| James Bond | 007 | secret agent |
| Play for Scala | 9781617290794 | book |
| three-quarters | 3/4 | fraction |
| Membrane Associated Ring-CH-Type Finger 1 | MARCH1 | gene |
| Norway | NO | country |

If you save this as CSV and open it in Excel, you get secret agent `7`, 
a book with ISBN `9.78162E+12`, the fraction `04-Mar`, and the gene `01-Mar`.
Excel doesn’t know about [non-numeric numbers](non-numeric-numbers),
but at least it doesn’t share
[The YAML Norway Problem](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why/implicit-typing-removed/).

## Workarounds

Since Excel only identifies UTF-8 when opening CSV that has a BOM,
you can ‘fix’ a UTF-8 CSV for Excel by prepending the BOM, e.g. with the command line:

```shell
echo -ne "\xEF\xBB\xBF" | cat - data.csv > data-with-BOM.csv
```

You can also force Excel to interpret values as text by prefixing the quoted value with an equals sign:

```csv
Name,Code,Type
James Bond,="007",secret agent
Play for Scala,="9781617290794",book
three-quarters,="3/4",fraction
Membrane Associated Ring-CH-Type Finger 1,="MARCH1",gene
```

Excel recognises dates in `YYYY-MM-DD` format, which you should probably use anyway.

These and other Excel CSV workarounds explain why some software offers separate _Export CSV_ and _Export CSV (Excel)_ options.
Alternatively, [Publish data using the CSVW standard](csvw),
and use Apple Numbers or Google Sheets instead of Microsoft Excel.
