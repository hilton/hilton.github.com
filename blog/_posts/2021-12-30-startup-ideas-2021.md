Startup ideas have [no business value](startup-ideas-are-cheap), 
but entertain me more than most Twitter cliches.

## Travel & entertainment

_1. Hotel ratings web site that lets you choose which six things you care about, and rates hotels accordingly._
Call it Six Star Hotels. Inspired by
[Bodil Stokke’s hotel reviews on Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=from%3A%40bodil%20hotel%20bodils).

_2. [Whatshalfway](https://www.whatshalfway.com) but for public transport, with a ‘minimise flights’ option._
Now we all work remote, want to meet quarterly, but would rather fly less.

_3. Faceted search for Netflix._
Netflix wastes your time with content you either don’t want to watch or already have.
Instead, I want it to ‘show me series, comedy, less than 30 minutes, not seen, not rated, released since 2010’.
Inspired by faceted search science fiction
[Programmer at Large](https://archiveofourown.org/works/9233966/chapters/20941043),
by David R. MacIver, and his tweet:

> Three words: Ubiquitious. Faceted. Search.
> 
> ‘Computer, find me all of the things. OK, now narrow it down to the ones with this property. Now highlight…’
> 
> We are surrounded by all of these giant databases of stuff, and almost invariably lack the basic tools to work with them.

_4. All-you-can-eat restaurant for programmers… called Steak Overflow._
Programmers love a good pun even more than [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com),
so they’d swarm this place and buy the merchandise.

_5. Reality TV set in an experimentally opened Dutch bar._
A panel of behind-the-scenes healthcare workers vote people who don’t maintain social distance out of the bar, during the COVID-19 pandemic, and into enforced isolation.

_6. Cafe with no talking allowed._
Curated ambiance. No noisy open-fronted drinks fridges either.

## Software as a service

_7. Zoom plugin that adds a _Muzak_ button to play elevator music during awkward silences and technical issues._
The Enterprise version only plays the approved corporate soundtrack.

_8. Blogging platform that starts off publishing a plain text document, and then adds another small feature to the set up for every 1000 words you publish._
The no-code version of spending more time building a CMS than actually blogging.

_9. Web site with the correct 
[alignment chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alignment_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)#Alignments)
for every software category._
Charge for the enterprise software listings.

_10. RSS reader that doesn’t track you._
When Google became evil, we all switched to
[DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) for search.
We still need a [Google Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader) replacement.

_11. Social media, but with citations and attribution._
It sounds implausible, but so did Wikipedia.

## Software development

_12. Issue tracker that acknowledges that the programmer mind is a stack._
Designed for working on an issue by first doing half the work, then creating several 'sub-issues' and recursing on those, until reaching a limit and continuing the second half of all of them.

_13. An open standard for compressed tabular data that does for CSV files what PNG and 
[WebP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebP) did for BMP and GIF files._
Today’s advanced data formats only serve niche applications.

_14. Global Variables as a Service._
It isn’t really global if it’s scoped to one system.
Generated names are free, 
[highly desirable meaningful names cost $99/year](https://www.hey.com/pricing/), 
ultra-short variable names are $349/year, and 
[politics is banned](https://www.theregister.com/2021/05/05/basecamp_political_discussion_apology/) 
because we’re asshole founders.
