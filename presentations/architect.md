Scrum doesn’t tell you to do software architecture.
It doesn’t tell you not to either.
If you build software and only do things mentioned in The Scrum Guide, you will neglect several things you might need.
While product owners focus on functional design, software quality and other non-functional requirements suffer.
Scrum projects need someone to focus on technical and non-functional stories, the same way the product owner focuses on user stories.
Scrum projects need software architects.

This talk explores how a software architect role can complement a development team’s product owner role.
Attendees will learn about system level topics that a user-story focus can neglect, such as non-functional requirements, architecture changes, and software maintenance.
We will also explore how to prioritise and plan this work alongside user stories.
