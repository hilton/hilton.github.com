Notion and Slack introduce two uses for emoji.
Notion uses emoji as page logos, making lists of page titles easier to browse.
This also works for headings within long pages, when you prefix headings with emoji.
Meanwhile, you can translate this [emoji vocabulary](emoji-vocabulary) to Slack,
and use emoji as message prefixes, to make channels easier to browse.

Slack introduced reaction emoji, which you can also use in Notion page comments.
Reaction emoji offer two different opportunities for clearer communication in online collaboration.

1. 👍 Symbolic emoji that form a kind of sign language
2. 😀 Emoji that represent emotions

Both kinds of reaction emoji save time when writing and reading online.


## Symbolic responses

Symbolic emoji abbreviate common responses.
You save time writing when you can use emoji instead of typing common responses to messages and replies.
Readers save time when they get used to these standard responses, and don’t have to read as much text.

Teams can use the following reactions in general discussion, for example:

👍 **approved** - approved, looks good to me, I agree, okay

💡 **aha** - I didn’t know that

💯 **absolutely** - I agree emphatically

🙌 **nicely done** - good job

🤦 **oops** - my bad

🤷 **shrug** - I don’t know, who knows?

🙏 **thank you**

🤔 **thinking** - I need to think about that

Teams sometimes explicitly document this kind of emoji sign language.
For example, a Slack support channel might use emoji reactions for status and resolution:

👀 **looking** - I have started looking into this

🎫 **ticket** - I’ve recorded this in our tracking system

✅ **done** - someone has now completed this task 

❎ **not done** - we don’t have to do anything there


## Emotional reactions

Emoji, in the original [emoticon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon) sense of _emotion icon_,
add an emotional layer to online communication that adds a little real human contact.

You save time writing when you can use emoji when you want to express emotion,
which otherwise risks requiring a lot of text.
If you don’t write novels, you probably can’t write emotion successfully anyway, and shouldn’t try.

Emoji lower the stakes for misinterpretation by communicating a more limited emotional vocabulary
that a team can use consistently.
Ironically, for people who grew up with a limited ability to express or recognise different emotions,
this emoji vocabulary may create opportunity for richer emotional communication, not less.

However, beyond a separation into broad categories - such as _more_ or _less positive_ -
groups of people use and interpret these emoji differently.

* positive reactions - 😀 😅 😬 😂 😭 😍
* less positive reactions - 😶 😮 😢 😔 🥺 😱 🤮

Teams who work together online, and especially remote,
can use this as an opportunity to build a shared emotional vocabulary.
Circumstances that make this vocabulary semi-private also make it feel safer to use.


## Emoji dialects

Teams that increase [psychological safety](comfortable-silence) can grow their reaction emoji vocabulary.
Team members’ increasing confidence that they understand each other creates space for richer emotional expression.
They start by increasing the number of emoji they use.
They also start substituting emoji, using different emoji for established meanings, 
such as the replacements 😂 → 😭 → 💀.

Teams reach the next level when they adopt a whole new emoji dialect.
For example, [blob cat emoji](https://slackmojis.com/categories/25-blob-cats-emojis)
express a much larger set of reaction emotions than standard Unicode emoji.
When a team member imports a set of blob cat emoji - or some other dialect - into Slack,
you know you have the best colleagues.
