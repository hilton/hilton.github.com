[TIL](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TIL) (‘today I learned’) is my favourite Internt slang, when it’s used to highlight new knowledge. I like it because it brings three things together: learning, sharing and online collaboration. Sharing discoveries in real-time with an online group is a form of [working out loud](https://about.yammer.com/yammer-blog/working-loud-mythbusting-tips/), which is a useful technique for softening the isolation of working remotely.

New ideas - whether useful or just weird - create a shared narrative. In social conversation, jokes and stories are just as important as serious news. Fortunately, Wikipedia is [sufficiently inclusionist](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deletionism_and_inclusionism_in_Wikipedia) to include plenty of both kinds of articles.
