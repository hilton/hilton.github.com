5. Annotations in HTML

Previously in this series, [Technical documentation annotations](annotations)
argued for directly annotating examples, to make explanations disconnected,
[API docs annotations](api-docs-annotations) explored how that might look for HTTP API documentation.
The following hypothetical example illustrates the key idea of arrows from example data to their explanations.

This mock-up came from a drawing and layout tool that made it straightforward to draw by hand.
To use this layout in practice, though, readers would want this documentation on the web.

## HTML

HTML and CSS make most of the layout straightforward.
The following HTML example
([HTML](api/pirates-artisanal.html),
[source](https://github.com/hilton/hilton.github.com/blob/master/blog/api/pirates-artisanal.html))
uses the same colours, with a 
[CSS grid](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout) layout.

This already looks useful, but also makes illustrates where the annotations stop working.
The first three annotation highlights appear too close together in the example on the left, and the second explanation on the right occupies too much vertical space, so they no longer line up horizontally.
The exampleâ€™s `Authorization` headerâ€™s bearer token does not obviously relate to its definition as a _Developer-specific API key_.
The same effects occurs in Google Docs and Notion, when a heavily-commented documentâ€™s side

Programmers tend to solve problems like this with machine-readable references and links.
While explicit references work, you get a better reader experience (RX?) with a more human solution.
Instead, do what youâ€™d do on a whiteboard: draw an arrow.

## HTML div element border

CSS provides the most straightforward ways to add visuals to rendered HTML documents.
In CSS, you can draw a line by adding a top border to an otherwise invisible absolutely-positioned `div` element.

![Annotations with horizontal arrows](api/pirates-artisanal-div.webp)

This example
([HTML](api/pirates-artisanal-div.html),
[source](https://github.com/hilton/hilton.github.com/blob/master/blog/api/pirates-artisanal-div.html))
adds a top border to three otherwise invisible absolutely-positioned `div` elements:

```css
.line { z-index:2; position:absolute; border-top:0.3em solid; }
```

```html
<div class="line" style="top: 7.5em; left: 6.4em; width:27em" id="line-ship-id"></div>
<div class="line" style="top:10.8em; left:12.8em; width:21em" id="line-api-key"></div>
<div class="line" style="top:31.9em; left:10.5em; width:23em" id="line-pirate-id"></div>
```

In practice, you would use JavaScript to calculate each lineâ€™s position and length.
However, when vertical spaces pushes annotations down, in the right column, you would need diagonal lines.
You could render a diagonal line by using a CSS transform to rotate the lineâ€™s `div` element.
Instead, letâ€™s try a solution that doesnâ€™t require trigonometry.

## Canvas

The [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API)
promises an easier way to draw arrows on an HTML page than, say, 
[SVG](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG).
Drawing a straight yellow line between `start` and `end` points requires the following JavaScript to draw on an HTML `canvas` element.

```javascript
const canvas = document.getElementById("canvas")
const context = canvas.getContext("2d")
context.lineWidth = 3
context.strokeStyle = '#FFEBA9'

const path = new Path2D()
path.moveTo(start.x, start.y)
path.lineTo(end.x, end.y)
context.stroke(path)
```

To use this, you need the coordinates of each highlighted elementâ€™s centre point:

```javascript
const start = document.getElementById("anchor-ship-id")
const x = start.offsetLeft + (start.offsetWidth / 2)
const y = start.offsetTop + (start.offsetHeight / 2)
```

In this final example
([HTML](api/pirates-artisanal-canvas.html),
[source](https://github.com/hilton/hilton.github.com/blob/master/blog/api/pirates-artisanal-canvas.html)),
the resulting arrows nicely connect the highlighted example text (left) with its explanation (right):

![Annotations with diagonal arrows](api/pirates-artisanal-canvas.webp)

Note that this required using the famously-tricky CSS `z-index` property to place the canvas behind the example text and explanation text, to avoid obscuring them, and in front of the background colour.

## Documentation systems

This experiment shows that documentation systems could learn from print publishing system layouts, and provide a visually simpler and more readable layout.
HTTP API documentation, in particular, could use simpler layouts than the overly complex deconstructed layouts that OpenAPI specifications encourage, such as
[Redocâ€™s](api-docs-backwards#deconstructed).
Now we just need a better API documentation tool that renders annotations properly ðŸ˜€
