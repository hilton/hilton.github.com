[Orbit](https://www.useorbit.io) manages _research_, _strategy_ and _planning_ data, 
which you use to track the product lifecycle from customer feedback to roadmaps.
I tried working in Orbit (but without a trip to the 
[ISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Space_Station)).

{:#planning}
## Planning

In Orbit, you describe and prioritise the kind of _opportunities_ that Teresa Torres describes in her book,
[Continuous Discovery Habits](https://www.producttalk.org/2021/05/continuous-discovery-habits/):

> I’ll refer to customer needs, pain points, and desires collectively as ‘opportunities’ - 
> they represent opportunities to intervene in our customers’ lives in a positive way.

Orbit opportunities get a tabular view, with filtering, and basic prioritisation inputs -
 _effort_ and _impact_:

I like how this keeps the prioritisation simple, with a fixed automatic prioritisation _rating_, such as _quick win_, 
instead [bogus arithmetic](product-arithmetic).

You use an opportunity’s page _Opportunity space_ tab to document the results of discovery work, 
and the _Solution space_ tab to collect and document solution design ideas.

Orbit’s text editing experience resembles Notion’s, with headings lists, and check lists, for example.
I like how you can insert one of several _discovery templates_ while editing, such as a four-part _hypothesis_ statement in an opportunity, or a _user story_ in a solution.
Only using templates to create new documents now feels old-fashioned.

As well as describing opportunities and solutions in writing, you can organise them in an
[opportunity solution tree](https://www.producttalk.org/opportunity-solution-tree/):

![Opportunity solution tree view](orbit/ost.webp)

I like the automatic layout, and the ability to drag unmapped opportunities onto the tree.
This avoids the fiddling and messiness of drawing and maintaining an opportunity solution tree with a general-purpose drawing or virtual whiteboard tool.

Finally, roadmaps visualise a subset of the whole tree map.
You add existing opportunities to this board view, and can drag them between columns.

You can’t add solutions to a roadmap, so you’ll need to use another tool for release planning and feature rollout.
I like how this positions Orbit for product management, without getting mixed up in how developers work, although I’d love to see Orbit become a [universal tool](universal-tools).
I also like how roadmap columns default to a 
[now/next/later roadmap](https://www.prodpad.com/blog/invented-now-next-later-roadmap/), 
although you can add and rename them if you must.


{:#strategy}
## Strategy

Opportunities link to _objectives_ and _personas_ - the more stable parts of your product strategy, and the root of tree maps.
The _Objectives_ page lists objectives, their metrics, and an expandable list of the linked opportunities.

![Objectives, and linked opportunities](orbit/objectives.webp)

Personas have a similar list, except that each has a detail page similar to each objective’s, with several tabs and a table of linked opportunities.


{:#research}
## Research

Orbit manages product feedback, which typically arrives via integrations, such as with Slack.
This is where you select feedback text to link to new or existing objectives.

![Feedback page](orbit/feedback.webp)

_Interviews_ automatically transcribe uploaded videos that you upload, so you can link customer interview quotes to opportunities.
I found this simple and easy to use, especially identifying and naming six different speakers in a long meeting.
This would greatly reduce the effort to capture direct quotes from customer interviews.

I like how Orbit boldly simplifies other tools’ models, linking directly to opportunities, instead of introducing intermediate _insights_.
I suspect that linking interview transcripts directly to opportunities neatly consolidates the work to synthesise customer needs into opportunity descriptions.


## Conclusion

Orbit delivers a more focused, cleaner and simpler experience than many product management tools.
More subtly, it shows excellent modern product management taste.
