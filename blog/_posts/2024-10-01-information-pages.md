*[B2B]: business-to-business - refers to software for companies, as opposed to B2C (business-to-customer) consumer software
*[SaaS]: software-as-a-service - web-based software that you don’t have to install and upgrade

People who have worked for a long time in a small business gain a kind of fluency in its information.
They remember regular customers’ orders, and know everything about their products.
Most people in a large business have to look this up all the time, though.
And you can make it easier for them.

## Information needs

People supporting business operations, such as a web shop’s customer orders,
frequently look up _business information_.
They need the details a specific customer, order, delivery or support request, for example.
These [business objects](product-backlog-naming#objects)
include both relatively fixed information, such as a customer’s name,
and historical operational data, such as their previous orders.

In the kind of business where you have customer meetings,
you’ll want some kind of dossier to read before the meeting,
so you don’t have to ask them questions your organisation’s databases already know the answers to.
Unfortunately, you probably don’t live in a historical TV drama,
and don’t have a secretary who will spring into action if you should from your desk,
‘get me everything we’ve got on Acme Corp!’

In practice, finding this information usually means knowing which software tool manages it,
and searching for it there.
In theory, we could automate that search, but modern business software doesn’t help much with that kind of thing.
[Federated search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federated_search) makes this information 
[findable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Findability) in theory.
In practice, not so much.

## B2B SaaS

Business software products have replaced the intranets of previous decades
(and the secretaries and filing cabinets of the decades before those).
Broad-category applications manage related collections of business objects.

A small [customer relationship management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management) (CRM)
tool manages customers/contacts and interactions with them,
while a larger tool integrates sales, marketing and customer support.
[Enterprise resource planning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning) 
(ERP) tools expand this to more business processes and areas,
such as physical products’ inventory and supply chain management.
Other teams’ tools provide a [system of record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_record)
for employees, and other business information.

## Intranets

Modern business software typically has one thing in common:
it supports business processes more than it supports general information needs.
Conceptually, it resembles the 1990s’ desktop software more than its web sites.
Before pervasive B2B SaaS, intranets consisted of internal web pages,
and custom user interfaces for centrally-managed databases.

A portfolio of SaaS applications doesn’t make an intranet.
Intranets used to _feel_ like the web, and SaaS doesn’t.
Intranets used to have _links_ and _pages_,
while business software has a complicated systems of animated user-interface components.
And half the time, the browser’s _Back_ button and history don’t work,
and you can’t bookmark the ‘pages’.

## Information pages

Once you start thinking of a business’ operational data as _business objects_,
you can refer to them unambiguously in documents and emails, e.g. 
_product BFG9000_, if you use [SKU codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stock_keeping_unit),
or _customer 3141_.
Then, in the same way that you can link well-known concepts in a blog post to their Wikipedia pages,
you can link these business object references to their intranet web pages.

We have an opportunity to rediscover 
[ambient findability](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/ambient-findability/0596007655/) 
for corporate intranets.
We can start by publishing business objects as individual intranet pages.
Then we give them well-known URLs that other applications and hand-written documents can easily link to.
