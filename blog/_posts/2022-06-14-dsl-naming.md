Software developers have used 
[domain-specific languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language)
(DSL) for decades without the concept becoming particularly popular.
Meanwhile, modern software development routinely includes many of them:
HTML, CSS, SVG, SQL, regular expressions, and various configuration languages.

Considering these languages’ success, it seems strange that software developers don’t talk about domain-specific languages more, let alone invent new ones.
Perhaps the concept of domain-specific language needs a better name.

## Domain-specific languages

The name _domain-specific language_ accurately describes the concept:
a computer language that targets a specific subject-matter domain, and often a particular application within that domain.
These domains often correspond to software functionality, such as typesetting or graphical layout, but may also describe more abstract concerns, such as business process modelling.

However, like other descriptive names, _domain-specific language_ lacks convenience and elegance, with the the boring initialism _DSL_ more common in actual usage.
Such a descriptive name also lacks the flexibility to encompass new related but adjacent ideas.

## Artisanal hipster languages

Artisanal hand-crafted designs better capture recent years’ hipster zeitgeist than a descriptive name.
From a derivative branding perspective, _artisanal hand-crafted languages_ and _hipster languages_ might sell better to a new generation of developers, even if that wouldn’t work for everyone.

The name _hipster language_ does suggest a niche and refined aesthetic, without actually excluding countless examples.
However, as
[Wikipedia notes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hipster_(contemporary_subculture)):

> Members of the subculture typically do not self-identify as hipsters, and the word 
> _hipster_ is often used as a pejorative for someone who is pretentious or overly concerned with appearing trendy.

DSLs deserve better than that, outside of ironic self-deprecation such as
[JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech), a Java-based (hence the _J_) development platform.

## Micro-languages

[Regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)
Domain-specific languages sometimes go by the name _mini-languages_,
referring to the constrained syntax and grammar that sometimes accompanies their constrained purpose, compared to general-purpose programming languages.
However, _mini-language_ sounds even more old-fashioned than _domain-specific language_, perhaps by association with the 1960s’
[minicomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minicomputer).

[Microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices)
suggest a more modern alternative: call them _micro-languages_, irrespective of their actual size.
After all, software architects don’t agree on 
[how small to make a microservice](https://www.ben-morris.com/how-big-is-a-microservice/).
And if you wanted to brand your micro-language as an _actually small_ micro-language, you could always call it a _nano-language_.

## Digital business languages

The above discussion looks inward, to the language itself, but modern DSLs would benefit more from a marketing-oriented perspective that considers who and what we create DSLs _for_.
If you create domain-specific languages for business users, you might instead call them _business languages_.

At the same time, business people these days don’t much like the term _software_, with its traumatic _software development project_ associations.
Software doesn’t eat business, these days; business goes _digital_.
We should therefore promote _digital languages_ to business people.
Unless, of course, the problem in comes from the word _language_.
