Just because most product roadmaps suck, doesn’t mean they have to be bad or that you don’t need one.
This presentation introduces product people and software developers to the wrong kind of roadmap, outcome-based roadmaps and how they relate to Scrum, vision and objectives, and the product roadmap triangle.

The right kind of product roadmap offers a useful tool for establishing direction.
This helps when agile software development methods make business stakeholders worry that instead of weaving together long-term narratives, you’re planning sprints like episodes of 
[Lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(TV_series)).
In the absence of evidence to the contrary, your sponsors will worry that you have no idea where you’re going and whether you’re ever going to follow-up on that polar bear, and other abandoned stories.
