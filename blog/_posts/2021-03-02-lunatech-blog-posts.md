People sometimes ask me about starting a public tech blog, to give developers an opportunity to write in public, and promote their work.
The recently-resurrected Lunatech Blog shows how I did this, from 2005 to 2014.
I started regular blog posts in my first year at Lunatech, which had no other online content marketing at the time.

I produced Lunatech’s blog by example, writing about half of the (roughly) twice-monthly posts myself.
I wrote about a variety of topics: technical articles for developers, agile software development, reviews, and company events.
At the time I didn’t worry much about which topics to choose, although analytics data gradually revealed that niche technical topics had the most long-term traffic.

## 2005

Looking back to 2005, I like the one about 
[information radiators](https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2005-10-07-information-radiators-dashboard-wall)
the most, because I found it so _satisfying_ to update the chart every day.
Of course, the 
[chocolate cocktails](https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2005-09-23-chocolate-cocktails-brain-food-after-work)
also delivered plenty of satisfaction.

* [JavaPolis 2005](https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2005-12-21-javapolis-2005)

From a technical writing perspective, the articles about web application user interfaces make me cringe now, because they say so little.
At the time, I had just started exploring the idea of writing about technical topics, and remember that using _How does this work?_ as a prompt, helped me start writing.
The post about 
[URLs in Struts](https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2005-07-29-struts-urls)
(a then-popular Java web framework) generated the most traffic, illustrating that articles that solve a real and recognisable problem have more value that merely describing things.

## 2006

In 2006, I tried two new things: book reviews and 
[a customer project summary](https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2006-07-25-development-ernst-young-indirect-tax).
Although I expect more readers found the
[books for software developers](https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2006-06-28-books-software-developers)
article useful, I still really like the think piece
[Wiki is my word-processor](https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2006-12-04-wiki-my-word-processor),
which I’ve thought about re-writing several times.
Now that we no longer use wikis, I would probably title that _Notion ate my wiki_ today.

* [JavaPolis 2006](https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2006-12-22-javapolis-2006)

I improved the tech blog in year 2 by building on the previous year’s web framework article success, with follow-up Struts tutorial articles.
Meanwhile, the 
[bullet lists](https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2006-09-11-how-use-bullet-lists)
article shows that I had started thinking more deliberately about technical writing.

## 2007

2007 started with another
[think piece about business class](https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2007-01-31-business-class-or-economy),
based on a conference presentation I’d seen at JavaPolis:
I don’t like the blog post much, but its insight still resonates.
Meanwhile, I started translating user group events (marketing budget spent on beer) into blog posts, and writing more tutorials.
My favourite article of the year remains the technical writing tutorial on
[how to write user-interface instructions](https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2007-03-08-how-write-user-interface-instructions).

## 2008

2008 continued previous themes: mostly company events, a review and a tutorial.
Fortunately, I still found space for a more quirky articles, in
[How to draw lolcats](https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2008-05-27-how-draw-lolcats) and
[The programmer’s private office](https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2008-07-22-programmer%E2%80%99s-private-office),
both disguised think pieces.

## 2009

In 2009, I returned to more serious technical tutorials, to write about JBoss Seam, our new favourite Java web framework at the time.
I don’t remember why I wrote fewer posts in 2009 than in other years, although spending half the year commuting to a customer’s office in, might have cost me the time I might have spent writing.
At least I had time for another 
[cocktail recipe](https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2009-12-21-chrimble-cocktail).

## 2010

The blog changed in 2010: I doubled my writing output, writing many more tutorials.
I also started to look at new kinds of articles, finding new topics in recruitment, and
[conference attendance tips](https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2010-11-23-10-devoxx-tips).

A new Java web framework drove this change, as I became a committer on the Play framework, to edit and write its documentation.
Writing on another ‘project’, five years after starting this tech blog, changed a lot about my experience of technical writing.

## 2011

I wrote even more blog posts in 2011, mostly as a result of writing companion articles to other activities, and experimenting with web framework documentation ideas.
Having decided that volume counts, this increase came from more systematically asking _can I blog about this?_
Today, the comparison of 
[Scala, Ceylon and Kotlin language goals](https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2011-08-24-scala-ceylon-kotlin-goals)
still resonates the most with me from 2011’s articles, not least because I wrote my first Kotlin code only two months ago.

2011 also featured another technical writing escalation: I started co-writing a book with two Lunatech colleagues that would take two years to complete.
This book -
[Play for Scala](http://bit.ly/playscala2p) -
taught us a lot about technical writing that helps people get things done, and improved how I approached tutorials.

## 2012

Developer conference presentations dominated my year in 2012.
I also wrote my first
[agile software development experience report](https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2012-07-29-double-sided-scrum-bord),
the first of several articles about Scrum, while in an interim Scrum master role on-site at a customer.
By this time I had become used to the idea that I should write about my current work, even if I would prefer to write about other topics.

## 2013

2013 saw fewer blog posts, presumably as a result of working on finishing our book.
After that, I applied what I had learned about writing tutorials to a new series about early versions of 
[Slick](https://scala-slick.org), a database access library.

* [Mapping Slick query results to case classes 1.0.1](https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2013-11-21-slick-case-classes)

These Slick tutorials explored a new technical writing constraint: no forward references.
I’d seen that in the book [Atomic Scala](https://gumroad.com/l/AtomicScala), as a way to make the book easier on readers.

## 2014

I kept up the writing pace at the start of 2014, with two posts per month at the start of the year.
Most intriguingly, I wrote about 
[remote working](https://blog.lunatech.com/posts/2014-03-10-benefits-of-remote-working),
eleven months before I would start permanently working from home (and have ever since).

I didn’t write any new topics in the months before I left Lunatech, at the end of June 2014, hence the series of retrospectives.
I did write a lot after that, though.
I left Lunatech for a six-month sabbatical in London, where I started [this personal blog](/blog/)
with a vengeance, writing 31 posts in the first two months. 😀
