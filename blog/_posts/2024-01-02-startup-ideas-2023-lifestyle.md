[You wouldn’t pay anyone for just a startup idea](startup-ideas-are-cheap), especially a stupid one,
but you might have the product management habit of thinking about the impact of solving a problem,
and trying to think of a feasible solution.

## First-world problems

### Watch List

People have terrible memories, and struggle to remember even one thing, such _don’t forget to take the shopping list_.
However, a shopping list on a smartphone doesn’t leave hands free for holding a basket and picking up shopping.
Instead, make it easy to refer to notes on the move, when you can’t use a phone.
For example, an Apple Watch app so you can _Send list to watch_ and show shopping list items one at a time in the supermarket.

### Supermarket Treasure Hunt

Supermarkets in foreign countries make it hard to find things, by challenging your assumptions about what shape packaging they come in, or simply not stocking them.
Produce a supermarket guide app for foreigners that (compared to where you live) tells you what you won’t find, what they disguised in different packaging, what they put in the ‘wrong’ section, and what you didn’t expect to find.

### Keyboard Kotatsu

When you work from home during the winter, you might get cold hands when you sit still at your desk for long periods.
Keep hands warm for typing with targeted heating, such as heated keyboards or above-keyboard heat lamps.
Touch typists might like a giant keyboard mitten enclosing keyboard, trackpad, and both hands -
like a desktop version of a Japanese [kotatsu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kotatsu).

### Parking Poseur

Some car drivers face disappointment every time their passengers fail to complement their excellent parking skills.
Give them recognition with car parking cameras that use AI to grade their parking skill (parking space alignment etc) and loudly announce the score to the car’s passengers.


## Entertainment

Entertainment ideas all address the same problems:
everyone wants entertainment, and loves originally, but can’t find any new ideas.

### Grand IT Designs

While corporate and government IT departments struggle with huge projects and bigger overruns,
civilians don’t get to enjoy the drama, or even know what goes on.
Fill the gap with a television series like [Grand Designs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Designs), 
but for enterprise IT software rewrite projects.

### Incredible Shrinking Discs

Older people with large CD collections don’t want to pay for music streaming services,
when they already paid for so much music that it takes years to listen to every album they own _once_.
Meanwhile, a large music collection might take up too much storage to fit on a smartphone at audiophile quality.
Instead, develop audio compression that reduces audio quality according to the listener’s age, removing frequencies they can no longer hear, so it all fits on a smartphone.

### Pod Farce

Solve the originality problem by copying
[Untitled Goose Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Untitled_Goose_Game) success,
while raising the stakes.
Use the concept - bothering people - but this time you play a orca, or the whole pod in co-operative mode, that harasses yacht harbours.

### Cocktail Stories

Retell forgotten stories, instead of making up new ones.
For example, produce a television series where each episode dramatises a classic cocktail’s origin story,
such as Tiki bar classic the [Zombie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_(cocktail)),
possibly invented in response to a hung-over customer who walked into a bar and said, ‘I feel like a zombie’.
