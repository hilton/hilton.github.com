[Continuous Digital](https://www.allankellyassociates.co.uk/books/)
([Amazon](https://amzn.to/2CUbMbW))
is what everyone in the software business needs to read, to understand how ‘IT’ and ‘the business’ are not separate. 
Even in small companies, you find a separate Engineering department, a separation that leads to all kinds of disfunction, which other books don’t address.

At first look, this looks like both a book about software for business people, and a book about business for software developers.
However, it goes beyond that by explaining how business constraints influence software development, and vice versa, which makes it a far more useful book than those that treats these topics separately. 

Allan Kelly builds on things you may already know about, to explain consequences you don’t.
Best of all, it’s a constructive and positive story that avoids the trap of merely complaining about what doesn’t work.
Instead, Continuous Digital covers a surprisingly large number of topics, from team composition and prioritisation to governance and budgeting.
The result is a large book that impressively delivers insights in each of its 26 chapters.
It’s a more substantial and rewarding read than [Project Myopia](project-myopia-review), but also a book I wish more of my colleagues had read in the past.

⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ **Recommended.**
