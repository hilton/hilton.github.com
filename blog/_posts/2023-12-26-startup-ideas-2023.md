Startup ideas have [no intrinsic business value](startup-ideas-are-cheap), but we can still enjoy them.
And from a product management perspective, they offer a regular reminder to separate the solution idea from the problem it solves.

## Awkwardly

Online meetings sometimes make it hard to tell why someone isn’t talking.
Develop online video meeting software that shows a social awkwardness meter, measured by facial recognition with AI interpretation.

## Might Delete Later

Scheduling a message for first thing Monday morning helps you pretend to start work early, but sometimes you want to ask a question on Sunday without anyone seeing it on Monday.
Build a team messaging app that as well as supporting scheduled messages, also allows you to set a response deadline for each message, to automatically delete questions when they will no longer be relevant.

## Meet Me Halfway

Calendar software hardly discriminates at all, and a fiercely protective secretary doesn’t come cheap.
Provide enterprise calendar software that encodes company-specific meeting invitation etiquette:

* who can invite who, in the organisation
* maximum attendees
* required purpose/agenda
* whether to ask before inviting
* use of blockers/placeholders, etc.

## 640 Characters (should be enough for anyone)

Solve the problem of people sending you longer messages than you have time to read, or just too many messages.
For example, add throttling/backpressure to chat/email clients to restrict what (specific) people can send you.

## Legiboard

Certain designs for text-based user interfaces prioritise an aesthetic over using variable amounts of text while actually being able to read it.
For example, Mural and Miro punish you for using more text than in their designers’ mock-ups, by reducing it to tiny sizes.
Instead, solve this with a product that uses #AI to keep the stickies tidy without making the text illegibly small.

## Zoom-In

Some conversations require probing questions that we take too long to think of, leaving discussions and interviews too shallow.
Help interviewers ask good follow-up questions, to get better answers, e.g. with an AI interview assistant that suggests follow-up questions in real time during an interview.

## Told You So

Effective group chat makes people lazy about repeating questions.
Combat this with a passive-aggressive AI bot that intercepts unnecessary direct messages with something like:

> ‘💡 Peter answered this question on Slack yesterday. Are you sure you want to send this message?
> [View Slack thread]
> [Send anyway]’

## Collaboration off the Shelf

Some new business software products only offer real value by adding collaboration features that became standard in the last ten years, wrapped in industry-specific marketing, as an alternative to legacy single-user desktop software.
Compete with them by starting a consultancy that optimises business operations by introducing 
[Trello](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trello) to people who’ve never heard of it, and who have either:

1. bureaucratic project/ops management using overcomplicated tools (Excel, Word, Jira), or
2. messy chaotic project/ops using only simplistic tools (telephone, email, sticky notes).

## Computer Says No

Solve the problem of not knowing in advance which potentially respectable companies are likely to give bad (customer) service.
For example, run a service like [Glassdoor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glassdoor)
but for insider reports on how bad companies are at software and data privacy.
Share how this affects customers whenever the primary product or service fails, such as when buying airline tickets.
