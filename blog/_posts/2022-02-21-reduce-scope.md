Sometime last year, a developer gave me an unusually specific compliment, 
calling me a good product manager because I reduce scope.
That reassured me, because along with the constructive aspects of product management, reducing scope provides a critical enabling constraint.

In fact, compared to all the other gross oversimplifications of product management, you could do worse than describe it _continuous scope reduction_.
This article explores what that means.

## Why reduce scope

In software development, building everything you can think of may sound appealing.
However, several factors conspire against it:

1. software development’s eye-watering expense
2. overly complex software’s terrible usability
3. everyone having a different opinion about what any given software lacks
4. how terrible most feature ideas sound when you say them out loud
5. how terrible even the most appealing feature ideas often turn out to be.

In general, even with good validation and design, a product team can usually generate good ideas several orders of magnitude more quickly than they can build them.
Meanwhile, scope seems to expand all by itself while you learn about the details of any problem you work on.

## Maximise the work not done

A naive approach to product development prioritisation imagines that you should prioritise product capabilities and improvements based on things like their return on investment, various kinds of risk, and alignment with your product strategy.
This still tends to give you more development work than you can handle:
for every good idea that will benefit your customer or customers, ten more want your attention too.

Effective prioritisation requires more than finding something important to work on;
opportunity costs mean choosing the _most important_ opportunities instead of trying to do everything.
If you don’t work constantly to _maximise the work not done_, the weight of an ever-growing backlog will inevitably crush your hopes and your dreams.
Reduce scope because your everyday happiness depends on it.

## You can always split a user story

I like to imagine a _fundamental theorem of agile software development_ that goes like this:

> _Theorem:_ you can always split a user story into two smaller pieces of development work.

It wouldn’t matter that the two smaller parts together might be more work in total than the original work, because you might not have to do both.
And although you might find it difficult to split user stories, you could practice.
However, most objections to the claim (not really a theorem) that you can split a story precede actually attempting to do so.
Therefore:

> _Corollary:_ you can’t split a user story if you never actually tried to do so

In practice, you can use a brute-force attack: try one of the many approaches included in
[The Humanizing Work Guide to Splitting User Stories](https://www.humanizingwork.com/the-humanizing-work-guide-to-splitting-user-stories/),
whose [story splitting flow chart](https://www.humanizingwork.com/the-humanizing-work-guide-to-splitting-user-stories/#flowchart)
includes nine story-splitting patterns.
