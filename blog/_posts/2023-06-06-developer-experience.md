A terrible truth holds many kinds of software development hostage:

{:.big style="max-width:30em"}
> Software development takes forever and costs all of your money

This especially hurts in-house business software development, where you can only spread development team costs across a small number of internal users.
Meanwhile, for software product companies, developer salaries account for a significant portion of total company costs.
Therefore, even small sustainable developer productivity improvements can have a huge long-term financial impact.

## Developer productivity

It gets worse: on top of the eye-watering cost of software development, we struggle to meaningfully measure developer productivity.
At best, we might measure proxies for _performance_ instead of productivity, such as the
[DORA metrics](https://dorametrics.org).

The newer [SPACE framework](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3454124)
offers a more sophisticated approach to software development team productivity.
SPACE addresses several persistent myths, and shifts focus to include the lived human experience of software development.

## UX - user experience

In the late 1990s, web-based user interfaces lacked the maturity of contemporary desktop software applications.
When Jakob Nielsen’s 1999 book
[Designing Web Usability](https://www.nngroup.com/books/designing-web-usability/)
introduced this web developer to usability issues, business software development projects were systematically neglecting to test or design for usability.

Since then, working on software usability has become uncontroversial.
[User experience design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design) (UX),
now forms a standard part of a cross-functional product development team’s work.
Inevitably, the regular practice of improving
[usability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usability) to make software’s _users_ successful, later led some teams to consider what makes _developers_ successful.

## DX - because developers are people too

[Developer experience](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3595878) (DX)
applies user experience thinking to developers’ work.
As [The SPACE of Developer Productivity](https://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=3454124) notes,
this impacts both developers’ happiness and productivity:

> For example, research has shown that high productivity is highly correlated with feeling satisfied and happy with work.
> Finding ways to improve productivity is also about finding ways to introduce more joy, and decrease frustration, in a developer's day.

Taking developer happiness as a (partial) proxy for productivity has led many teams to improve their productivity by improving their developer experience.
However, not every team achieves this by themselves.

## Developer experience teams

As software development organisations scale, they typically struggle to improve the developer experience for an increasing number of developers.
Large software development organisations ultimately resolve this by forming an enabling team that delivers developer experience improvements to other development teams - a _developer experience team_.

Despite the promise of substantial developer productivity improvement, scaling organisations still struggle to form an effective developer experience team.
Too often, the overwhelming number of improvement opportunities overwhelm new developer experience teams, and lacking the experience to effectively prioritise their work, they struggle to focus.

This lack of alignment, and the lead time to learn and implement new techniques, threatens to delay improvement in KPIs, such as DORA or SPACE metrics, which may lead to disillusionment.
Without early successes, despite the high cost of senior developers not directly working on product development, management will disband the team.

## Fractional developer experience teams

Companies that take the long view, and avoid beginner mistakes, will eventually benefit from focusing on developer experience.
The rest can benefit from using external experts to get things started more quickly, and heading in the right direction with a plan that sets them up for success.
Having experienced all of the above more than once, I’m happy to see some of the experts I’ve worked with offer this. 

Recommendation: if you are growing, or have already grown, a software development organisation without successfully forming a developer experience team, talk to the
