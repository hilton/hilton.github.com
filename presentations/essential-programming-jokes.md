Programming jokes are underrated.
They encode essential knowledge that every programmer should know, carry dark warnings from the past,
and give us the opportunity to share our pain.
And some of them are even funny.
When we learn and share classic jokes, we connect with people through shared experience, 
or discover an opportunity to teach them something new.
Let’s level up our skills, and have some fun.

Attendees will learn what programming jokes are for, how to tell them, and what they can teach you.
You’ll also learn when to ignore the conventional advice never to explain a joke,
and when having to explain a programming joke is a feature, not a bug.
Actionable takeaways focus on best practices for joke deployment and,
of course, you’ll learn a new joke or two.
