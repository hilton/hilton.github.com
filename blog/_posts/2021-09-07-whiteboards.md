If you ever wanted to know how many whiteboards your software development team members need, you just found the correct answer: _one each_.

## The Scrum board does not replace a whiteboard 

Most of the development teams I ever worked on had one whiteboard, which we used for the Scrum or Kanban board, because it gave us a convenient way to draw the board.
It turns out that we shouldn’t have only used our whiteboard for the Scrum board.
You need a whiteboard for day-to-day discussions, so you can use it as a rapid-prototyping tools for text and diagrams. 

Writing on paper stickies with a whiteboard marker and then sticking them to a whiteboard wastes wastes the whiteboard’s one job: providing a convenient surface to write on.
Any flat surface would do for a tasks board, although you may get in trouble if you draw columns on the wall with a marker.
Instead, you can just tape paper signs to the wall to indicate the Scrum board columns, such as _To do_ and _Done_.

## High-bandwidth communication 

Software developers spend a lot of their time _talking_ to each other, either face-to-face, via video chat, or asynchronously via text chat.
Software development requires a lot of this ad hoc communication, which it emphasises over written documentation.
Agile methods do this for three reasons:

1. to avoid fixing information such as software requirements until as late as possible
2. because it doesn’t take as long
3. because a conversation between two people has higher bandwidth than writing a specification. 

The highest bandwidth communication between two people combines face-to-face verbal communication… plus a whiteboard.
This combination gives you a conversation with quick diagrams. 

It matters that you use low-fidelity [back-of-the-napkin|http://www.danroam.com/the-back-of-the-napkin/]-style diagrams that you can draw quickly.
This part doesn’t work as well on a computer, where diagramming software invokes a time warp.
Time slows down while you endlessly fiddle with box alignment and arrow placement.
A picture sometimes takes as long to produce as a thousand words.

## Team whiteboards 

Despite whiteboards’ usefulness, many teams have a single shared whiteboard.
Just one.
If your team only has one whiteboard then they can only have one high-bandwidth conversation at a time.
Unless you exclusive use team programming, this unnecessarily constrains communication.

Centralised discussion belongs old-fashioned school classrooms and meetings, not for software development teams.
Treating a whiteboard marker like a software development team’s talking stick annoys programmers as much a version control system that locks files on check-out.
(Yes, that used to happen, and 
[frequently ended badly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Visual_SourceSafe#Criticism).)

Sometimes you can tell that you don’t have enough whiteboards: 
they run out of space, and team members have to write ‘DNE’ (do not erase) on whiteboards that other people use.
Heuristic: you don’t have enough whiteboards when you have fewer whiteboards than people.

## Remote ‘whiteboards’

Working remotely changes your relationship with whiteboards.
Although you might have one where you work, it no longer provides a shared space, and unless you have a second high-quality camera for it, no-one else can see it properly.
Distributed teams need effective electronic solutions instead.
