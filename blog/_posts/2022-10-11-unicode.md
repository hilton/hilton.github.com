Writing doesn‚Äôt only use different languages, it also uses different _alphabets_.
Along with writing‚Äôs language, modelling used to have to consider its
[writing system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing_system), or _script_.
Fortunately, from a software perspective, 
[Unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) solved this problem over twenty years ago.

## Plain text

In the past, people talked about _plain text_ without specifying its
[character encoding](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-what-is-encoding)
(how the software stores characters).
This tended to either mean that you didn‚Äôt know which characters (and therefore alphabets and languages) the software supported, or that you didn‚Äôt know about (and couldn‚Äôt use) characters not used by US English.

> There Ain‚Äôt No Such Thing As Plain Text.  
> _Joel Spolsky_

Dylan Beattie‚Äôs excellent [Plain Text](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd5uJ7Nlvvo)
presentation thoroughly explores this particular rabbit hole.

Today, [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text) means Unicode-encoded text that can (more or less) include any character from any of the world‚Äôs writing systems.
Or, at least, it should.

## Use Unicode

If your software never has encoding bugs, such as Windows‚Äô
[Bush hid the facts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bush_hid_the_facts) bug,
you got lucky _and_ did something right, from the start.
If you get character encodings wrong, by failing to use the same Unicode encoding everywhere in your software, and mixing encodings, your software will be plagued with annoying encoding bugs.

Encoding bugs typically result in mangled text, also known as [mojibake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake),
a Japanese neologism with colourful translations in various languages
(from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mojibake#Problems_in_different_writing_systems)):

| Language | Name | Transliteration | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Bulgarian | majmunica | –º–∞–π–º—É–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ | monkey's [alphabet] |
| Chinese | ‰π±Á†Å / ‰∫ÇÁ¢º | Lu√†n m«é | chaotic code |
| German | Buchstabensalat |  | letter salad |
| Hungarian | bet≈±szem√©t |  | letter garbage |
| Japanese | ÊñáÂ≠óÂåñ„Åë | mojibake | character transformation |
| Russian | krakozyabry | –∫—Ä–∞–∫–æ–∑—èÃÅ–±—Ä—ã |  |
| Serbian | ƒëubre | —í—É–±—Ä–µ | trash |
| Spanish | deformaci√≥n |  | deformation |
| Vietnamese | ch·ªØ ma / lo·∫°n m√£ |  | ghost letter / disorder |

Surprisingly, the Wikipedia page lacks an Icelandic entry, although
[√ìlafur Waage suggested](https://twitter.com/olafurw/status/1576164217228500992) _n√¶rskiljanlegt_ (near/close understandable).

When you have an encoding bug, and you can‚Äôt fix it quickly or the development team doesn‚Äôt understand how, then you have a bigger problem than a single bug.
Of course, by now, developers have all read Joel Spolsky‚Äôs classic 2003 article,
[The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets (No Excuses!)](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/).


## Default encodings

Software components and tools, such as databases and text editors, often still encouraging encoding bugs by default.
Their default configurations often don‚Äôt use Unicode, for backwards compatibility with old software.
That generally makes less sense now than it did twenty years ago, and probably doesn‚Äôt happen as much.

From a software development perspective, it means checking that every system component that handles text uses the same Unicode encoding by default, or that you have configured to do so.
On a more positive note, this becomes less necessary over time.
Personally, I look forward to when we don‚Äôt have to talk about Unicode any more.
Or _PIKE MATCHBOX_.
