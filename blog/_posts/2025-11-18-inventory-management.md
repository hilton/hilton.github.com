In 2020, I started playing an _inventory management_ game at home.
I signed up for a supermarket home delivery service,
to avoid the supermarket during lockdown.
This introduced an interesting complication:
a minimum order value that often meant ordering too much.

## Home inventory

I started with a two-part problem:

1. Reach the minimum order value every week.
2. Eventually use all purchased stock.

The obvious solution involves topping up orders with Champagne,
to reach the minimum order value, but I didn’t want to make a habit of that.
Meanwhile, some orders cost well over the minimum,
such as when I needed more dishwasher tablets, or other infrequent purchases.

## Spend control

To avoid ‘having’ to order bubbly every other week, I added an objective:

{:start="3"}
1. Minimise the value of each order.

I started spreading out infrequent purchases, especially expensive ones.
This meant tracking my home inventory, and ‘topping up’ orders to the minimum value,
by _stocking up_ in advance.

This resulted in an inventory of over 100 stock items,
tracking each item’s **product name** and **inventory** (quantity).
Most food items appear in the storeroom photo (above), excluding fridge and freezer contents.

## Storeroom location

I updated the inventory before each order, to check what we’d run out of.
Going through the list required a consistent space for every stock item, and new rules.

{:start="3"}
1. Store each product in a consistent location in the storeroom
2. Don’t run out of space in the storeroom

I recorded each stock item’s **shelf** location,
using spreadsheet-style column-row references:

These locations remained stable,
except for occasional relocations to accommodate _maximum inventory_ changes.

## Price optimisation

Supermarkets continuously operate
[sales promotions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sales_promotion),
and I could browse discounts for the week containing the delivery date.
This created a new opportunity when stocking up:

{:start="5"}
1. Use discounts to minimise each stock item’s average price.

This made the game even more _satisfying_, but caused a new problem:

![Spaghetti overstock – 12 packs of spaghetti and spaghettini](inventory/spaghetti.webp)
￼

After a series of [BOGOF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_one,_get_one_free) 
(buy one, get one free) offers, I had ordered lots of spaghetti and _spaghettini_
(blue/yellow packets in the centre of the photo, above).

## Overstock

Spaghetti lasts a long time, but not necessarily _for ever_.
I discovered that we use several products more slowly than I had realised,
and that I had overachieved during some enthusiastic discount-driven stocking-up.
I had to refine the second rule:

{:start="2"}
1. Eventually use all stock, **before its _best before_ date**.

I use tinned tomatoes every week, and they last for years, so I can really stock up.
But whatever the discount, I shouldn’t have more than six packs of flour tortillas.
To set limits, I estimated each stock item’s **maximum inventory**
that would avoid [overstocking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overstock).
Then, given a discount, I could safely stock up to the maximum inventory.

I occasionally had to adjust the _maximum stock_.
To make it easier for slow-moving products, I added the product’s **shelf life** –
the number of months until its _best before_ date, on delivery.

## Inventory management

I can’t do even this trivial inventory management in my head,
and the supermarket web site doesn’t help me manage my home stock.
Inevitably, I had to use another software tool to do this, which leads to the next part of the game.
