If you read a lot, you should [accumulate unread books](unread-books),
so you always have something to read next.
When you do it properly, you’ll have to [get an unread-books bookcase](unread-bookcase)
to accommodate them all.

## The bookcase curation problem

A whole bookcase of unread books gives you plenty of options for what to read next,
but only when you solve the bookcase curation problem.
Without some kind of plan, you end up with a random selection of books you don’t really want to read.

The well-curated unread-books bookcase has the same variety as the books you like to read.
This of course requires self-reflection and honesty about the difference between the books you actually read,
and books you want to _have read_.

## Genres

I have four genres in my various bookcases, both _read_ and _unread_:

1. my favourite genre
2. guilty pleasures, for easy reading
3. ‘normal’ fiction, for balance, variety, and new discoveries
4. non-fiction, to read in parallel with fiction.

If you read more than one genre, or both non-fiction and fiction,
you’ll need at least one option for each.
Alternating between genres and authors lets you introduce easy reading after a tough read,
while stopping the easy reading’s formulaic writing getting stale.

## Lengths

My unread books include epic trilogies, that really keep you going,
and postpone book completion disappointment.
But sometimes, I only want a short detour into a different genre between longer books.

In each genre, curate a mix of short novels, longer novels, and whole series.
Then you can read different genres in turn, for the variety, but also choose your pace.

## Dimensions

While I generally avoid reading more than one novel at a time,
I don’t want to take the last fifty pages of a book on holiday.
Similarly, when I go on a day trip, I take a slim small-format (178 mm) paperback,
instead of carrying a heavy brick of a book, or an oversized trade paperback.

Books tend to all come in the same shape, but they do come in different sizes.
Curate your unread bookcase to include sizes and genres suitable for reading on the go,
so you can always have a book with you when you find yourself stuck somewhere.

## Recommendations

I have a few prolific favourite authors,
and can easily fill my unread bookcase with safe options that I know I will like.
I also need variety, and the occasional new author, though.
Recommendations help with both.

Ask everyone whose taste you respect to recommend the best book they’ve ever read.
Make a list, and don’t forget to write down who recommended each book,
so you can have a fun conversation about it later.
Besides, when you hesitate to take a chance on a new author or genre,
it helps to have someone to talk to about it, or even blame.

## Random bargains

When I visit the UK, I like browsing the secondhand books in high street charity shops,
which typically cost £1–3, and occasionally less.
I buy anything I see by any of the dozens of authors I usually read,
or who someone has recommended.
[World of Books](https://www.worldofbooks.com/en-gb) offers an online alternative.
Secondhand bargains inject welcome randomness into my bookcase curation.

If you can afford to buy and accommodate a year’s worth of unread books,
you can reduce the average purchase price by buying bargains.
And when your unread bookcase fills up,
more strictly applying a maximum secondhand price limits the accumulation rate.
It also means you have less reason not to pay full price for a new book,
when planning and curation fails, and you haven’t already got the book you want to read next.
