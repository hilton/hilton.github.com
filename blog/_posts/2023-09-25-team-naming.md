When I talk about work, I often talk about the team, and how we work together.
In some companies, especially during rapid growth, you spend a lot of time talking about teams in general:
team structures, team dynamics, and even [team topologies](https://teamtopologies.com).
Some companies complicate this topic by having _more than just teams_.

## Matrix organisation

Some companies introduce a more complex structure than a simple hierarchy.
In addition to their place in the hierarchy, people belong to other groups, such as specialism-based
[communities of practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Community_of_practice).

[Matrix management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_management)
introduced this idea of structuring an organisation by more than one of business unit, product line, job function, geography, etc.
People in a matrix organisation report to more than one manager, as a result of belonging to more than one of these groups, in addition to their main team.
But some companies have decided that they don’t have _teams_.

## Culture hacking

Companies use [culture hacking](https://www.cultureamp.com/blog/culture-hacking)
to tweak the employee experience with (often small) intentional changes,
such as in-house jargon and employee perks.
Unfortunately, companies endlessly imitate each other until the hacks become tasteless clichés:
table tennis/football in the break room, and adopting a new words for _team_.

A famous example in tech originates in a report about
[Scaling Agile @ Spotify](https://blog.crisp.se/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/SpotifyScaling.pdf) (PDF),
which describes organising teams into an overlapping matrix of:

* squads
* chapters
* guilds
* tribes.

Despite the authors’ warning that their article described a ‘current way of working - a journey in progress’, the so-called _Spotify model_ meme became endemic in agile software development circles.
Today, we see the meme’s success in the number of companies that have copied the team naming (but not necessarily the agility).

## Sport and military team types

The least tasteful part of abandoning the word _team_ comes from choices that typically feature military jargon:

* squads
* units
* company officers
* staff engineers (from [staff officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staff_(military))).

This jargon reflects deeply entrenched (!) warfare metaphors in business, along with _targets_, _campaigns_ and market
_[penetration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penetration_(warfare))_.

Military metaphors also inspires the sporting jargon that companies also like to adopt. 
For example, IT consultancies’ typically refer to staff as _on the bench_ between assignments.
Software development teams often like to adopt
[sports team names](https://www.sportsfeelgoodstories.com/sports-team-names/),
typically based on wild animals (not the cute kind).

While I consider sport metaphors in business less tasteless than military metaphors, I’d hardly call them _inclusive_.
Meanwhile, bro-culture and culture hacking combine to replace _team_ with arbitrary meaningless synonyms.

## Words mean things

In an similar vein, Martin Fowler 
[questions our metaphors](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MetaphoricQuestioning.html),
focusing on the trap of identifying software development with another profession:

> I'm very suspicious of using metaphors of other professions to reason about software development.
> In particular, I believe the engineering metaphor has done our profession damage

Fowler warns against the danger of trying to follow metaphors and analogies too closely.
Similarly, many alternative team type names hinder the sense of belonging that a good team creates.
When you reflect and how you and your colleagues organise yourselves and your work, 
start from what the word _team_ means, not from some military, sport or feudal medieval analogy.
In particular, question the suggestion that you and the people who you work with every day shouldn’t proudly call yourselves a _team_.
