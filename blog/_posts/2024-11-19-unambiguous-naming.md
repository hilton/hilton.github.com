Someone I know recently received an invitation to speak at an academic conference.
The conference name at the top of the invitation letter included ‘Congress Helsinki 2025’.
The letter also contained practical information, including the location for the lecture:

> The session will be held on 03/04/2025, from 09:00 to 10:00 in Copenhagen*.

They didn’t expect a Helsinki conference to have lectures in Copenhagen.
Although international collaborations sometimes complicate things,
a mistake in the invitation letter would also explain a location in another country.

They double-checked the location, before deciding whether to book a flight to Finland or Denmark.
It turns out that the conference venue has named the lecture theatre ‘Copenhagen’.

## Naming difficulty

Despite the [well-known difficulty of naming things](why-naming-things-is-hard),
naming a meeting room after a location fails unnecessarily badly.
The ambiguity will inevitably create confusion.

I have also experienced meeting room confusion,
while working for a company that named their Berlin office meeting rooms after Berlin districts.
This didn’t usually cause problems, and we didn’t think a ‘team meeting in Tiergarten’ meant having a picnic.

However, asking after a colleague who happens to live in Prenzlauerberg makes ‘in Prenzlauerberg’ ambiguous.
You don’t know whether to look for them in the meeting room, or contact them at home.
Next, you’ll tell someone that, ‘they didn’t come to the office today’.

## Avoid bad naming

As with all naming problems, start by not naming things badly - _ambiguously_ in this case.

* **Place names** give you a nice set of names to choose from, but  _Copenhagen_ and  _Tiergarten_ create ambiguity that doesn’t encumber, say, [asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_exceptional_asteroids).
* **Cute themes** for meeting rooms, such as _The monkey cage_ (not made up!), become awkward or embarrassing before long.

Instead, you should at least manage to do better than:

* **concise and unique (but boring) names** - when you call the third meeting room on the second floor _MR 2.3_
* **hotel rooms**, like  _Room 203_ - only slightly less boring
* **famous people’s names** - not ambiguous, but can result in things you want to ever have to say out loud when someone asks where to find you (‘you’ll find me in…’).


## On-brand naming

[Tableair writes](https://tableair.com/blog-75-creative-meeting-room-names-ideas-and-mistakes-to-avoid/)
that creating meeting room names ‘offers a unique opportunity to reflect a company’s culture, values, and creativity’.
For example, in 2018 I ran a workshop at a [Dutch hotel](https://www.kapellerput.nl/en/floor-plan/)
whose _MeetingDesign Team_ has chosen meeting room names that align with their _MeetingSuccess_ goal.
Translated, they include:

* The Cooperation
* The Experience
* The Creativity
* The Inspiration
* The Interaction
* The Challenge

At least these names avoid ambiguity, with definite articles to make them stand out in sentences like,
‘I’ll see you after lunch in _The Inspiration_’ (you can hear the emphasis).
No doubt they also perform well in their target market.

Despite this sophistry, meeting room names too closely associated with an organisation or its business still risk ambiguity.
In domain-driven design terms, these names deliberately reuse domain language from bounded context in another.
These meeting room names don’t _sound like_ meeting room names.
