In this talk, Peter will share his favourite programming jokes.
Some of them are even funny.
What’s more, Peter is going to explain them all properly, which is probably why he doesn’t get invited to parties.
In the middle of serious explanations and actually-funny variations of standard jokes, attendees will discover the serious side to programmer humour.
Attendees will cringe at old jokes, laugh at new ones, and learn about how programming jokes form a critical part of our shared cultural identity.
