[Feature lifecycle management](feature-lifecycle) helps internal stakeholders prepare for
[feature rollout](feature-rollout).
It also creates the opportunity to transform your roadmap.

[Ditch the Timeline Roadmap](https://www.prodpad.com/resources/guides/ditch-the-timeline-roadmap/)
explains the benefits of a lean roadmap, and how to get people on board with the idea, but not how to get there.

You could do worse than throwing your existing feature-based timeline roadmap away, and starting from scratch, but you might prefer to start from your existing feature roadmap.
Use the following steps to rephrase your plan instead of discarding it.

## Features → opportunities

Start by making the dates less important, by replacing each feature with the underlying
[opportunity](https://www.producttalk.org/2019/02/prioritize-opportunities/) it addresses.
This step assumes you know why you put those features on the roadmap; if you didn’t, figure that out first.
It works because these opportunities typically have a broader scope, and longer lifetime, than any particular roadmap item.

Replacing features with opportunities improves the roadmap in two ways:

1. **simplifies** the roadmap, reducing the number of items, possibly increasing their size
2. **rephrases** - shifts the language from software solutions to business problems.

In general, releasing a feature doesn’t completely resolve the opportunity, and in some cases you could work on an opportunity indefinitely.
This means that instead of planning a feature (with a specific scope), your roadmap plan now identifies a problem that you’ll work on for a particular period, such as a month or two.

## Dates → months

After you have replaced the features, it makes less sense to plan to work on a problem until a particular date (no longer a release date).
Now you can reduce the time scale precision to whole calendar months.

Instead of showing how many days you plan to work on a feature for, the roadmap now shows in which months you’ll work on which opportunity.
This works works because a product strategy roadmap doesn’t need to show how much effort you’ll spend on each problem.
Instead, you show what the team will work on now, next, and later.

## Months → now/next/later

Your calendar month (or quarter) opportunity roadmap’s
[lack of detail makes it more stable](product-roadmap-triangle), and easier to keep accurate.
You could stop here, with a greatly-improved roadmap, but you’ll get even more benefits from a lean roadmap, which answers three questions:

1. Which opportunity do you focus on right **now**?
2. Which opportunity will you address **next**, given what you know now?
3. Which other opportunities have you identified, that align with your product strategy, and you might work on **later**?

In practice, these three buckets may correspond to the opportunities you expect to work on this quarter, next quarter and 6-12 months from now.
But not necessarily: the _later_ column could look further ahead, as well as including multiple options.

On a date-based roadmap, you can’t add options for 6-12 months in the future without them looking like definite plans.
Switching from an absolute timescale to this relative prioritisation makes it easier to add options in the _later_ column, and for stakeholders to understand that they don’t represent commitments.
